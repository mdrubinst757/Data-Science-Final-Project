 At Academy Foot & Ankle Care, our priority is to deliver quality care to informed patients in a comfortable and convenient setting. Quality Care 
 When you have problems with your feet, you need to turn to a podiatrist who listens and responds ... an experienced doctor who knows the field and can effectively diagnose and treat your needs ... a  physician who counsels you on the best ways to maintain and improve your health. Plus, you benefit from a dedicated, friendly, and caring staff who give you the individualized attention you deserve. Informed Patients 
 Dr. Lambert believes that informed patients are better prepared to make decisions regarding their health and well being. That is why we've included an extensive section on this web site covering the full array of topics associated with podiatry and podiatric diagnoses and treatments. We encourage you to look through these pages whenever you have an interest or concern about your feet. Comfortable, Convenient Setting 
 The best care in the world doesn't mean anything if you can't access it. At Academy Foot & Ankle care we strive to make our office as efficient as possible. It is our 26th year at the same convenient location in Goodlettsville. Included in these web pages is information about  Academy Foot & Ankle Care, including our Goodlettsville location, maps, directions, hours, insurance policies and appointment scheduling. You can even email a  request for an appointment  right here! 
 We hope you find this web site useful and invite you to  contact us  with your questions at any time.

 THE ALC MISSION 
 
“To provide quality care in the least restrictive environment allowing
children to become life long learners.”
 
 
ALC is different due in part to our innovative curriculums which helps to develop an eagerness to learn while creating a fun, safe, and nurturing environment. We explore fine arts, learn Spanish, sign language, and integrate fun and brain-stimulating activities into everyday activities.
 
 Learn more about our curriculum 
 
 
 
 Why Choose Us? 
 Our commitment to your child 
 
 
 Staff Longevity 
 
We think one of the most important components in your child’s education at ALC is the consistency of our teaching staff.
Most of our teachers have been with us for five years or more—with some having tenures of over a decade. In addition to providing your child with that continuity, it also provides you with the knowledge that our teachers truly enjoy the family atmosphere of ALC. This continuity helps your child adjust more easily to their “second home” during the day, and provides an uninterrupted flow of love and care until you return each day.  
 
 Nationally & State accredited 
 
Active Learning Center is nationally accredited by the National Accreditation Commission and recognized in the State of Tennessee as a 3 star center. Our owner serves on the board of the Association for Early Learning Leaders. Our Vice President is an Ambassador for the Association for Early Learning Leaders and a Validator for the National Accreditation Commission. We are also members of the National Child Care Association.
 
 
 Parent Involvement
 
 
If you or anyone you know would like to visit one of our classrooms to share/read a story at story time, share your occupation or want to help with an art project, we would LOVE to have you! Contact your child’s teacher.

     Treatment Designed For You  
    
 Each patient is unique, requiring equally distinctive treatment programs. While chiropractic adjustments are important, they are only one health care tool. Some patients need adjustment, others benefit from muscular manipulation or trigger point dry needling. A majority of our patients require a combination of joint manipulation, muscular therapy and rehabilitation techniques. 
 
       
      
      
     
     
     
     Correct the Cause of Injury  
    
 We offer an evidence-based, integrated approach to your healthcare. The key to this model is to diagnose not only the symptoms you have, but WHY you have them. At Active Spine and Joint Center we take the time necessary to uncover the root cause of your painful syndrome and do what it takes to correct it. 
 
       
      
      
     
     
     
     Integrated Care  
    
 Our office specializes in conservative care for musculoskeletal injuries. In some cases it is beneficial to work with other medical professionals to provide you with the care you need. If further medical intervention is needed or warranted we will work with your current PCP or other medical professional to make sure you receive the highest quality care.

  AdamsPlace is affiliated with National HealthCare Corporation, founded by Dr. Carl Adams, a physician and lifelong resident of Middle Tennessee. Dr. Adams and Jennie Mae Adams, had a long-held dream of building a \"campus concept\" of lifecare facilities for older adults.  Their objective was to provide older adults with a beautiful, secure, and caring environment as they aged, free from the daily worries of cooking, cleaning, and caring for a home. Dr. Adams also hoped to provide a way for married couples to stay together, even if the health of one required a different degree of care.  AdamsPlace does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability or age in admission, treatment, or participation in its programs, services and activities, or in employment.

                               DiSC Personality Inventory, strategic planning sessions 
                               Adventureworks programs accomplish specific objectives, using interactive group exercises, problem-solving challenges, facilitated discussions, group and individual reflection, feedback,  ropes courses  (also called \"challenge ropes courses\" or \"challenge courses\"), and  personality profiles  (including DiSC and Myers-Briggs Type Inventory).

Leadership sessions create opportunities to examine leadership and followership styles, give and receive productive feedback (360 feedback), acquire new leadership tools and strategies, and practice leading a team towards specific objectives.

Over the years I've had great difficulty when it came to getting a good night's sleep. I would toss and turn, wake with headaches, sore throat and complaints from my wife that I was keeping her awake. Finally convinced, I had my physician do a Sleep Study on me in a sleep lab. The results indicated that I had Obstructive Sleep Apnea. My physician prescribed a BiPAP machine and that changed my life dramatically. I'm now 67 and have no trouble getting a good night's sleep ... my wife now gets a good night's sleep, too.Â

         Â  Â  My name is Dr. Richard Allen.Â  My goal is Â to educate the Murfreesboro community andÂ my patients about the best Chiropractic has to offer along with other natural solutions to common health problems in order to motivate you to take a more active and responsible role in restoring and maintaining your own health as well as the people around you.  
 Â Â Â  As a chiropractor,Â I understand that althoughÂ my patients may be diagnosed with the same condition, they respond very differently to treatments. For this reason,Â I tailor a specific plan of action to meet your needs, goals & unique medical and physical condition. Â Â Â  Finding a chiropractor who understands changing health care needs and the most current techniques and approaches to addressing health problems can be a daunting task.Â I hope that you will find this site helpful in learning more about chiropractic care as well as the ways that it can improve the quality of your life.  
 Â Â Â Â Â Our officeÂ also offers spinal decompression therapy, which has been successful in treatment of serious spinal conditions and disc problems. This is just one of the many reasons that when people look for Murfreesboro chiropractors, they look to Allen Family Chiropractic for answers.  
 Â Â Â  If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at (615) 217-2345 or email us at  allenfamilychiropractic@gmail.com Â and a member ofÂ myÂ staff will be happy to help you!

   Welcome 
   Allergycare of Cool Springs is pleased to offer a new, exciting and innovative allergy treatment that doesn't require shots! Whether your symptoms include sneezing, congestion, a runny nose and itchiness in the nose, roof of your mouth, throat, eyes or ears, you can now benefit from allergy DROPS. This simple, safe and effective treatment has been used in Europe for decades and works by placing customized drops under your tongue — which can be administered at home, without injections! 
  Better yet, seasonal allergy sufferers can benefit from allergy drops too! Simply by starting treatment before your impending allergy season arrives, you can build tolerance to the allergens from which you suffer and reduce your symptoms before they start. 
  So if you don't like or don't respond well to shots or other allergy therapies, allergy drops are the ideal solution.

 At Allied Hearing Care, our mission is to provide you with the highest quality of hearing health care available so that you can rediscover your hearing and reconnect with the important people and things in your life. Quality hearing health care begins with a thorough hearing evaluation. You will be seen by a fully licensed, doctoral audiologist. Based on your results and your needs, you and your audiologist can decide the best hearing solution for you.  Our office is conveniently located off I-65 in the Rivergate area. Off Rivergate Pkwy, turn onto Gleaves Street. We are open Monday through Thursday 8:30 am - 4:30 pm and Fridays 8:30 am - 12:30 pm. Saturday hours are available by appointment only. We offer convenient walk-in hours for hearing aid users for cleaning, checks, and general maintenance, or minor repairs. Most insurance is accepted.

Our chiropractic treatment services are safe and effective and address the originating cause of the pain or discomfort. In chiropractic care, the hands are used to gently manipulate the spine to restore proper bodily function without the use of prescription medication.

                 Lawn Mowing 
                 
                 Regular and proper mowing is one of the most important practices for keeping your lawn healthy. We use top of the line Toro brand commercial mowing equipment to give your lawn a superior cut and appearance. We do the work, and you get the compliments. 
               
               
                 Landscaping 
                 
                 Your yard is an extension of your home, and a beautiful, professionally landscaped lawn  adds  value to your home. Your back yard can serve as a playground for  the children, a place of peaceful sanctuary for adults, or a hub for entertaining friends and family.  
               
             
             
               
                 Aeration and Overseeding 
                 
                 Each  summer lawns in the Murfreesboro area battle against high humidity, high temperatures, and very wet   and/or very dry  conditions. Aeration and  overseeding are vital to your yard's continued good health, and our aeration and overseeding program is the best in  the area. 
               
               
                 Trees and Shrubs 
                 
                  Having and maintaining a proper mix of trees and shubs  is great way to add value, a sense of invitation, and to frame the picture of your home. Regular pruning and weeding of your  property sets your house apart from the rest of your neighborhood.

                Introducing AngioScreenÂ® - The First Step to Better Health 
               AngioScreenÂ® is a simple, non-diagnostic vascular screening designed to provide you with information about your circulation and your risk of heart disease and stroke. 

                An AngioScreenÂ® will provide you with information about your heart rhythm, neck and leg arteries and fitness. Providing you, the participant, clear results of your vascular condition is the first step in helping you lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke. 

                If you are interested in scheduling an AngioScreenÂ®, please call 
                                                            1.866-STAY-HEALTHY (1.866.782.9432)  or visit our  schedule a screening

 We hope that the information provided here answers many of your questions about endodontic treatment. If you would like additional information, please don’t hesitate to contact us at any of  our locations. 
 Root Canal Treatment  
 A root canal is one of the most common dental procedures with well over 14 million performed every year. This simple treatment can save your natural teeth and prevent the need for dental implants or bridges. For more information on root canal treatment at our Nashville TN endodontic office, please visit our  root canal page. 
 Root Canal Surgery  
 Endodontic (root canal) surgery can be used to locate fractures or hidden canals that do not appear on x-rays but still manifest pain in the tooth. Damaged root surfaces or the surrounding bone may also be treated with this procedure. The most common surgery used to save damaged teeth is an apicoectomy or root-end resection. For more information on root canal surgery at our Nashville TN endodontic office, please visit our  root canal surgery page.

For older ages it depends on the maturity of the child. Young children do not have the ability to sit down and talk about their about their feelings, their problems, or their worries. The language of children is play.

    As managing partner at Momentum Label Group, it is my responsibility to make certain our artists are given every advantage in today's complicated tech smorgasbord. I have been extremely impressed with Jon Walker and his young team as they go the extra mile to promote our artists Jamie O'Neal and Rachele Lynae. They are passionate about all the ways to brand and promote artists plus they work great with our team. Jimmy Murphy Managing Partner of Momentum Label Group Working with the folks at Marco Music is always a pleasure. They are always there to help by keeping our programming dept updated on the latest music coming out of Nashville. With them onboard, our station is at a great advantage. Without it we suffer. Jordan Lyles Program Director of KSKE Ski Country The Charlie Daniels Band has used the services of AristoWorks for everything from a sponsorship/marketing deck on Charlie Daniels to producing electronic Christmas cards for The CDB. They are one stop shopping - literally can provide everything from video shooting, graphic design, great ideas plus technology to make it work in today's world. They are our \"go to\" company when we need something to stay up to date in today's digital world. Bebe Evans Director of Touring at CDB, Inc.

 Behavior drives results. 
Communicate meaningfully. 
 The way we communicate is changing at an unprecedented pace. The future demands new strategies and new skill sets. 
 Become your own media. 
 In today’s world, self-publishing is an important part of the marketing mix. Being your own media means writing and distributing content that showcases your competitive advantage and helps your clients solve their business problems. It’s not selling; it’s teaching. With the right content, any company or person can become an authority.

   The truth is... 

 when we strengthen families, we nurture and fulfill our children's need for trust, respect, and affection, and ultimately provide a lifelong foundation for healthy, enduring relationships. 

 API promotes parenting practices that create strong, healthy emotional bonds between children and their parents. For life. So they can take those bonds with them into their adult lives and share them with their children. And their children can do the same. A life cycle of compassion and connection.

   Parenting As A Hero's Journey - featuring API's Lysa Parker and Barbara Nicholson  
  
   
   
      
 
   Do you think of yourself as an ostracized weirdo or a hero on a journey? The Old Story, with its demands for cultural conformity, wants you to believe you are crazy for questioning it, much less taking steps away from its prescription for living your life and enculturating your children. The New Story, however, views your impulse to question and abandon culture, and its threat of disapproval, as a Call to Adventure, the first step on an epic Hero's Journey. 
 
 
 
 Don't worry, you're still a freak for questioning and abandoning culture, much less trying to change the world, but Evolution Could Not Happen Without The Freaks-of-Nature Leading The Way. 
 So hoist your freak flag and meet us over at the  Parenting As A Hero's Journey website  where we are headed for a full year of LIVE Virtual Retreats with like-hearted adventurers, freaks and heroes to explore and take home with us the treasures of conscious living and parenting. As Joseph Campbell, author of The Hero of a Thousand Faces and creator of The Hero's Journey monomyth wheel said, “We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.” 
 API's own Lysa Parker and Barbara Nicholson are guides on the journey, discussing  Mindful Parenting: The Spiritual Essence of Attachment. 
 
 
 
      
      
          
     
    
         
         
         
 
  
   
   
      
 
   API Reads: March update  
  
   
   
      
 
   In the book  Love and Anger , we’ve discussed so far how anger is a natural emotion. A lot of the readers in the book club felt reassured that they weren’t the only ones to have felt this way before. They enjoyed the stories that the shared in chapter 1 to show examples of situations in which we as parents can become angry.

   Your Parent Compass...Reflecting on 20 years of API   
  
   
   
      
 
   
 Summer 2014 
 “We later met all of the founders of La Leche League, who told us that if they hadn’t been so overwhelmed with focusing just on breastfeeding education and support, they would have loved to do what we were doing--focusing on parent education. It was obvious to them that their model of mother-to-mother support was needed by all parents, whether they were breastfeeding or not, as parenting is so demanding without mentors, peers and listening ears.”

 MEET DR. ADAMS  
        I grew up in East Tennessee and graduated from East  Tennessee State University in Johnson City.  I then started my career as a microbiologist. I worked in this field for  several years before attending medical school in Nashville at Meharry Medical  College, where I graduated with honors and also trained. I have always practiced in Rutherford County  — first in Murfreesboro, but since 1999, I have had a solo practice in Smyrna.  
 We have always maintained a setting where patients feel care, compassion, and concern as opposed to only being \"medically  managed.\" Our patients can expect  to be treated respectfully, ethically, and professionally. We are able to care for the vast majority of  primary medical issues you or your family member may have. In the event a specialist's care is needed,  we will take care of the referral from beginning to end. Nearly all specialists are represented within  blocks of our clinic.   
         Specialists can also be found inside or outside our county. We are always mindful of one's insurance  carrier and network recommendations. Furthermore, we take great pride in making  sure all financial aspects are taken care of properly, including the billing of  your insurance.  
         If you are tired of feeling rushed or  \"just a  number\" at your current primary care provider, or if you or a family  member are without one, please give us a try and decide for yourself.

 Welcome to  AuthentiQ TAX Service  
 Preparing your  taxes can be a hassle!  So let the people at  AuthentiQ Tax Services  help you this tax season. Because we know that doing your own taxes can leave you with more questions than answers.  
 
 Now a days  today’s tax laws  are more than we can handle, even filing a   relatively simple return  can be confusing. What is a tax return ? It is just credit that you are entitled.

         In March of 1998 Advanced  
 
          Protective Services, Inc was founded. One year later, Doug Jones became  
 
          a full partner. In August of 2002 Mr. Jones took total control of the  
 
          firm becoming the President/CEO. Mr. Jones brought with him 17 years  
 
          in the entertainment business with celebrity/VIP executive protection  
 
          details experience to the table. The vision was to create a private  
 
          protection/investigations business with professional and ethical standards  
 
          serving the private and public sectors thus effectively \"raising  
 
          the bar\" in the security and investigations industry.  
 
         The Company is made up of  
 
          five divisions. The first division is the Executive Protection Division.  
 
          This division provides protection to Corporate, Celebrity, Dignitary,  
 
          and VIP clientele. Our Agents are highly trained to handle sensitive  
 
          and logistical situations. All aspects of our clients' protection will  
 
          be addressed through our personal protection teams in the most efficient,  
 
          skilled and confidential manner. Our teams are available for national  
 
          and international assignments  
 
         Our second division is the  
 
          Guard and Patrol Division. This division provides Agents for events,  
 
          property protection and public safety situations. Our patrol teams provide  
 
          Paramedics and First Responders, combined with armed (or unarmed) agents  
 
          to provide response to alarms and on call requests to neighborhoods  
 
          and business communities. Our Team can consult and/or develop your security  
 
          plan of action.  
 
         The third division is the  
 
          Sworn Officer Division. This division provides off-duty uniformed Police  
 
          Officers for traffic control, public safety and property protection.  
 
          Our Company works hand in hand with the local Police Departments all  
 
          over the State to provide the most efficient way for the private sector  
 
          to secure uniformed security services.  
 
         The fourth division is the  
 
          Private Investigation Division. This part of our Company provides short  
 
          or long-term investigations for both the public and private sectors  
 
          for both criminal and civil cases. Our Agents capabilities include interview  
 
          and interrogations, loss prevention investigations, surveillance, and  
 
          under cover operations. Our state certified expert private investigators  
 
          consist of Agents with experience in numerous government agencies.  
 
         The fifth division is our  
 
          training and seminar division. Our Agents with backgrounds in military,  
 
          government, and police departments can conduct and are licensed to provide  
 
          certified training to police and SWAT teams, firearms training, Rapid  
 
          Deployment (for schools and local police, fire and medical teams), hostage  
 
          rescue, as well as corporate seminars on national and international  
 
          travel threat assessments, office bomb threat procedures, Rape defense  
 
          for women and many other safety procedures including a complete security  
 
          assessment and safety procedure manual for your facility.

          A. P. S., is in full compliance with The Tennessee Department of Commerce  
 
          and Insurance. Our Company carries over 6 million dollars in liability  
 
          insurance. Further, Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability as  
 
          required by Tennessee State Law cover our Team.  
 
         Our clientele includes some  
 
          of the most successful companies and recognizable celebrities. We can  
 
          mention only a few. They are The Gaylord Entertainment Center (Nashville  
 
          Arena), Adelphia Coliseum, The Exxon/Mobil Corporation, Nashville Gas,  
 
          Central Parking, The Governor's Club (an Arnold Palmer golf course and

          many other groups, corporations, celebrities and government officials  
 
          (including courtrooms, judges, lawfirms, Senators etc).  
 
         Our Company has become the  
 
          most reputable company in the Tennessee area. Our reputation has been  
 
          built on trust, integrity, and confidentiality. We will continue to

         PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS  
 
         ANYTHING, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME.  
 
          (As long as it is legal!) This is our motto. We have a team of full  
 
          time dedicated investigators that are equipped with the latest technology  
 
          and training for conducting any type of civil or criminal investigation.  
 
          Our investigators come from backgrounds in local, state and federal  
 
          investigative agencies. We have taken that core training and years of  
 
          experience in criminal and civil rights matters and relocated that expertise  
 
          to the private sector. This transformation has developed into the \"Dream  
 
          Team\" of the civilian world - Just what you want and need on your  
 
          side. This team is expert in many fields. This combined with our continued  
 
          positive relationsihp with law enforcement officials on all levels allows  
 
          us the opportunity to bring all this expertise to your needs at precisely  
 
          the right moment, and just for the time desired.  
 
         We can help you in the following  
 
          ways.  
 
          CIVIL Divorce, worker's compensation, child custody/retrieval, process  
 
          service, background checks, surveillance of all types and general planning/consulting  
 
          about your specific problem.  
 
          CRIMINAL Internal thefts, insurance fraud, robberies, larceny, corporate  
 
          espionage detection (we have all the technology to sweep for bugs, phone  
 
          taps, video sources, etc.), narcotics (we have our own K-9 and certified  
 
          handler), and any other crime against persons or property. DON'T WAIT  
 
          FOR AN OVER-WORKED POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PAY YOU THE ATTENTION YOU DESERVE!  
 
          DEFENSE If you have been charged with a criminal offense, we can work  
 
          with you and your attorney(s) to gather important information surrounding  
 
          your case to assist in your defense. REMEMBER, WE HAVE BEEN THERE AS  
 
          LAW ENFORCEMENT, we know what should, can and can't be done legally.  
 
          All of our services are completely confidential. We can draft an investigative  
 
          course of action to a client's specific needs. Each person is different,  
 
          each business is different and each problem has to be approached in  
 
          a new and ingenious way. Call us and we will let you know how we can  
 
          help.  
 
         GUARD AND PATROL  
 
         Our Guard and Patrol division  
 
          is the best in the country, bar-none. We provide uniformed and plain-clothed  
 
          agents who are fully licensed, bonded and have the capability to arrest  
 
          and detain. We do not hire transient guards who roam from company to  
 
          company in search of the easiest post of duty. Our men and women are  
 
          drawn directly from the ranks of the military and police departments.  
 
          We demand more from our Team. We take care of our clients and their  
 
          direct interests (property, customers, etc.). Our agents are trained  
 
          in proactive security that DETECTS, DETERS and AVOIDS criminal activity.  
 
          Call us for a no-cost consultation. We guarantee we can save you money  
 
          in the long run by doing a better job and increasing your business.  
 
          We believe in public relations because we are fully aware that the first  
 
          person a potential customer comes into contact with is ususally the  
 
          \"security guard.\" A bad experience with this individual can  
 
          set the tone for the remainder of their visit.  
 
         The greatest advantage to  
 
          having your own hired agent, whether armed or unarmed, is the flexibility  
 
          you get to take care of your own situations. We do not break the law  
 
          or commit unethical or immoral acts under any circumstance, but we do  
 
          have (and pass on to the client), the ability to use discretion in dealing  
 
          with how we handle intoxicated persons, thieves, panhandlers and other  
 
          unwelcome persons at your event or venue. With this discretion, we can  
 
          arbitrate the unruly behavior, thus creating an end result that will  
 
          be beneficial to the client on many fronts, especially avoiding adverse  
 
          publicity. If an arrest is necessary or desired, then our relationship  
 
          with area law enforcement officials, accompanied with the action of  
 
          our men and women, will restore order to, and remove liability from  
 
          the client's property.  
 
         SWORN OFFICER DIVISION  
 
         This division provides uniformed  
 
          or plain-clothed certified police officers for off-duty purposes. It  
 
          takes a special type of company with a reputation for excellence in  
 
          the field for police chiefs and sheriffs to allow their full-time personnel  
 
          to be employed in the field for the benefit of a private client. Advanced  
 
          Protective Services employs over 250 police officers at events as large  
 
          as NFL football games all the way down to the corner store that desires  
 
          a uniformed offcer on the weekend for protection. Our pricing is competitive  
 
          in the marketplace and MUCH cheaper and easier than going through a  
 
          department's internal division to hire the same services.  
 
         Alarm Response Runner Service  
 
         Don't let late-night false  
 
          alarms disturb you again!  
 
         Our service picks up where  
 
          your company's security system leaves off. If the alarm system is triggered  
 
          after hours, we get the phone call. No more late-night disturbances.  
 
          No more anxious drives into the office, wondering who or what you'll  
 
          find when you get there. We take care of it all. And if it's more than  
 
          a false alarm? Our experienced, professional agents are trained to handle  
 
          any situation. And when it's resolved, you'll know everything we do.  
 
          There's no better way to be safe--247. Call today for more information.

 Welcome to Our Office  
 
    
 
 We are conveniently located in the Target Shopping Center next to Hibbett Sports and GNC.  
 
    
 
 Whether your child is ready to visit for the first time, your spouse wants to discuss whitening, or your parent needs dentures, we will treat you and your loved ones like members of our family. We have created a warm, pleasant atmosphere so that our patients can feel comfortable in our practice and confident in our care.  
 
    
 
  \" The wonderful part about having a family dental practice is that in most cases I am able to treat the entire family, which allows me to get to know my patients and develop a long-term, quality relationship with my patients while providing for their dental care needs. I feel this is incredibly important, because you and your family are important to me. My staff and I are very grateful for the patient relationships that have helped our family practice grow. As we continue to grow, we invite you and your family to grow with us.\" - Dr. Andrea Hannahan  
 
    
 
 As a family-centered and patient-oriented office, we want to spend time getting to know our patients on an individual basis. We offer general and cosmetic dentistry for all members of the family. We will find the best, quality treatment options for the best value to fit our patients' individual needs. We take the time to listen to your concerns and questions so that we can treat the patient, not just the problem.  We treat patients of all ages and every member of the family - toddlers, children, teens, adults, and seniors.   
 
    
 
    
 
 Please take the time to get to know us. We welcome you to visit our office and meet the staff to learn more about the care and services we offer.    
 
 We look forward to meeting you!

 Welcome, and thank you for visiting Eye Health Partners & Vision America! 
 At Eye Health Partners & VisionAmerica we are dedicated to enhancing and preserving our patients’ most precious sense of sight.  We take pride in caring for our patients’ vision by combining state of the art technology with the most experienced surgeons.  Treatments are based on the unique needs of each patient and are delivered with compassion and respect. 
 Our Commitment 
 Outstanding patient care – that is the goal of the doctors and staff at Eye Health Partners & VisionAmerica. We believe that comprehensive, quality eye care is best delivered to our patients through the cooperation of optometrists and ophthalmologists. At our multi-specialty centers, patients come in contact with some of the nation’s leading ophthalmologists in the specialized fields of  refractive surgery  (such as  LASIK  and PRK),  cataract treatment , vitreoretinal care,   glaucoma management , pediatric ophthalmology,  strabismus  treatment, and oculoplastic procedures. 
 Our Mission 
 Since the inception of VisionAmerica in 1989, our mission has remained unchanged. We are dedicated to providing the highest quality eye care available while advocating the cooperative efforts of optometry and ophthalmology through clinical care, education, and research. 
 Selecting an Eye Surgeon 
 Undergoing any surgical procedure can be stressful, especially if it involves something as precious as eyesight. When choosing a surgeon, it is important to choose someone with superior knowledge and experience. Most often, the best source for choosing a surgeon is the family eye doctor. They can explain their experience with different surgeons and provide knowledgeable recommendations to assist with this very important decision. 
 Having served Alabama and Middle Tennessee since 1989, Eye Health Partners & Vision America have built our reputation as centers for excellence. As such, our specialists consult with and serve the patients of more than 700 optometrists and over 100 medical physicians, who trust our commitment to provide the best possible care for their patient. 
 Co-Management 
 Optometrists, who serve as family eye doctors, perform routine eye exams and treat many diseases of the eye. However, when surgical intervention is required, patients are referred to an ophthalmologist who specializes in the surgery required. Our highly trained specialists do not provide routine eye care, which the patient will still need, so they are then referred back to their family eye doctor.   This joint sharing of patient care is known as co-management. Co-management combines both the skill and knowledge of both doctors to provide the best medical care possible. Successful co-management of Eye Health Partners &  VisionAmerica  with optometrists comes from a relationship built on mutual trust and respect that is developed through shared learning, constant communication, and a commitment to providing outstanding patient care.

         The American Liver Society is founded in memory of everyone that was infected with  Hepatitis C   and other blood borne diseases as a result of tainted blood and blood products. Our mission is to help those Americans that contracted Hepatitis C from the nations blood supply and those affected as a result of the domino affect. Other countries around the world have compensated there victims and are prosecuting some of the people responsible for manufacturing and administering these tainted blood products.Canada has set up an 800 number for people to call to give any information about the tainted blood scandal in there country we would like the American Government to do the same for what is no doubt one of Americas greatest medical tragedies.As an American who has lost a brother to AIDS and Hepatitis C and is also infected with Hepatitis C as a result of tainted blood it is my goal to make sure these companies and people responsible are prosecuted and convicted for there crimes against humanity.This site contains  adult  material and is not suitable for children for we cover topics ranging for murder to sex.

  Endodontists  are dentists who specialize in maintaining teeth through endodontic therapy procedures, involving the soft inner tissue of the teeth, called the pulp. All dentists are trained in diagnosis and endodontic therapy, however, some teeth can be especially difficult to diagnose and treat.  That’s why you may have been referred to an endodontic specialist.

    Welcome to the website of Dr. Paul J. Somers Jr., DPM. Dr. Paul Somers Jr. specializes in all aspects of podiatric medicine. Your feet are an essential part of the body and are many times overlooked. When your feet hurt they can impact your overall health and well-being. When symptoms and ailments are left untreated they can lead to more serious complications.   Podiatry is the medical and surgical specialty that concentrates on the care of your feet. As a trained professional and board-certified podiatrist, Dr. Somers, along with his entire staff, is devoted to providing patients with real results in alleviating foot problems. These might include bunions, hammertoes, warts, ingrown nails, neuromas, heel spurs, fractures (and other sports-related injuries) which are easily treated by medical, surgical and orthotic therapies. Our office is equipped to perform laser and shockwave treatments as well as minor surgeries. Dr. Somers also provides surgery at many of the local hospitals including Baptist, St. Thomas, Centennial, Skyline and Horizon Medical Center.

  Dedicated podiatrists provide quality care in a comfortable, convenient setting   At Neuhaus Foot and Ankle, we are a dedicated podiatry office focused on helping patients get the right information for their foot and ankle ailments or injuries. Our priority is to deliver quality care to patients in a comfortable and convenient setting.  We want our patients back on their feet as quickly as possible.  
 
  
Your foot and ankle problems can be pretty scary because almost everything you do relies on being mobile, and podiatry issues can be very detrimental to normal living. From ankle sprains to blisters, and Achilles tendon tears to ingrown toenails, Neuhaus Foot and Ankle can work with you to discuss options for treatment and recovery.  
Our podiatrists, Dr. Matthew Neuhaus, Dr. Jason Knox, Dr. Francis Hawthorn, Dr. Martin Toy, Dr. Peninnah Kumar, and Dr. Aaron Allred serve the Middle Tennessee area with locations in Smyrna, Brentwood, Lebanon and Hermitage. Quality Care  
When you have problems with your feet, you need to turn to a podiatrist who listens and responds. You need an experienced doctor who knows the field and can effectively diagnose and treat your needs. You need a friendly physician who counsels you on the best ways to maintain and improve your health. Our podiatrists meet all these criteria. Plus, you benefit from a dedicated office staff of trained professionals who give you the individualized attention you deserve. If it can go wrong with your foot, our practice can help you.  
Our podiatrists provide patients with a variety of treatment options for recovery. Their focus on providing personal care and treating the patient as well as the ailment has been a staple at Neuhaus Foot and Ankle for years. The office’s professional staff provides individual attention for every patient who comes through their doors. Call today at  615-220-8788  to have your questions answered. Informed Patients  
Neuhaus Foot and Ankle believes that informed patients are better prepared to make decisions regarding their health and well being. That is why we've included an extensive section on this web site covering the full array of topics associated with podiatry and podiatric diagnoses and treatments. We encourage you to look through these pages whenever you have an interest or concern about your feet. Comfortable, Convenient Setting  
The best care in the world doesn't mean anything if you can't access it. At Neuhaus Foot and Ankle, we strive to make our offices as efficient and convenient as possible. Included in these web pages is information about Neuhaus Foot and Ankle, including pictures of our Smyrna, Brentwood, Hermitage, and Lebanon locations, maps, directions, hours, insurance policies and appointment scheduling. You can even email a request for an appointment! Neuhaus Foot and Ankle: A resource for you  
If you’re frustrated because over-the-counter and home remedies are not working for your condition, contact an experienced podiatrist who can go over your other options and get you back on your feet. Our doctors discuss all the available options with our patients, including physical therapy, medications, and surgery when necessary. Neuhaus Foot and Ankle works with patients and provides a plan for foot recovery and maintenance of foot health in the future, and believes patients should have a say in their healing process.  
This website provides a wide selection of information on common foot ailments, along with directions and hours for our podiatrist office in Smyrna and in Brentwood. Take a look around the website and get to know our team. Once you know we’re healers you can trust, call  615-220-8788  to  set an appointment  to meet with Dr. Neuhaus, Dr. Knox, Dr. Toy, Dr. Hawthorn, Dr. Hasler or Dr. Allred in one of our convenient locations.

 Welcome to the Advanced Neurosciences Institute.   
  
  
  
 Our staff is in the tenth year ofÂ providing neurology services in the Nashville Area.  We try to provide the very best neurological care and services which are possible today. Our current practice was formed in 2002 to provide for a nearly continuous expansion of neurological services required for those clients with complicated to diagnose and manage conditions. The old neurological practice of \"diagnose and adios\" is no longer a suitable modus operandi in the 21st century.  
  
 At ANI, our goal is to clarify what your problem is, whether more than one condition contributes to your symptoms, obtain as firm a diagnosis as is possible, initiate a treatment plan, and coordinate your care with other specialists and your primary caregiver.

              Testimonial 
                  \"Dr. Mehta has been my physician for over 10 years. He and his staff provide me with quality care. His nurse practitioners, Elizabeth and Jannyse, are extremely talented and proficient in their care. When I go to SimplyCare, I feel like a family member. The office staff and technicians always greet me by name and are interested in me as a person as well as a patient. I know when I need treatment, that they will be thorough in their diagnosis, run specific tests, and provide a well thought out treatment plan. Professionally and personally they are the best care providers I've had.\" - Tony Cicirello

                     Your initial appointment will consist of a consultation explaining your diagnosis and treatment options. Occasionally, treatment can be done the same day as the consultation.

                     A denture, or a complete denture as it is often called, is an appliance that is inserted in the mouth that replaces natural teeth and provides support for the cheeks and lips.

 Welcome! Dr. Anthony P. Urbanek and this site are dedicated to helping patients and physicians alike find a better understanding of the causes, symptoms and treatment of Temporomandibular Joint Disease (TMJ/TMD). Throughout this website you will find information and tips about TMJ, treatment details regarding Dr. Urbanek's TMJ Splint (patent-pending) and Patient Success Stories. 
   
 \"I am making this information available to you hoping that the number of patients making the rounds of doctor after doctor without a definitive diagnosis can be correctly diagnosed and directed.  I have seen hundreds of patients, primarily women, who have suffered with TMJ symptoms for five, ten, twenty years without resolution, essentially ruining their lives. They are so grateful when they find out that their symptoms resolve so rapidly with such a simple treatment regimen once the actual cause is discovered.\"  - Dr. Tony Urbanek 
If you have any questions regarding your symptoms or treatment options, you can contact Dr. Urbanek's primary office  here . 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dr. Urbanek has an article featured in the April issue of  Middle Tennessee Health & Wellness Magazine . Be sure to take a look and learn about how bruxism can cause Temporomandibular Joint Disease and how we can help tackle your TMD/TMJ pain! 
   
 Visit  Middle Tennessee Health & Wellness Magazine 's website  to see the entire article or look for it in local Middle Tennessee businesses and doctor's  offices.

The source code that generated this unhandled exception can only be shown when compiled in debug mode. To enable this, please follow one of the below steps, then request the URL: 1. Add a \"Debug=true\" directive at the top of the file that generated the error. Example:  Â Â <%@ Page Language=\"C#\" Debug=\"true\" %> or: 2) Add the following section to the configuration file of your application: <configuration>  Â Â Â <system.web>  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <compilation debug=\"true\"/>  Â Â Â </system.web> </configuration>  Note that this second technique will cause all files within a given application to be compiled in debug mode. The first technique will cause only that particular file to be compiled in debug mode. Important: Running applications in debug mode does incur a memory/performance overhead. You should make sure that an application has debugging disabled before deploying into production scenario.

       Welcome 
 For several years, HCA has had a comprehensive ethics and compliance program, which includes: 
 Articulating standards of compliance and ethical conduct 
 Creating awareness of these standards among everyone in the company 
 Providing a means to report exceptions ( i.e.,  possible misconduct) 
 Monitoring and auditing performance in areas of compliance risk 
 Establishing organizational supports for this entire effort 
 Undertaking other efforts such as Clinical Ethics and Pastoral Services

       HCA’s Code of Conduct –  A Tradition of Caring  – provides guidance to HCA colleagues and sets forth ethical and legal standards. We encourage you to read our   Code of Conduct  Booklet   and see the high standards by which HCA colleagues live. 

 While we have a comprehensive Code of Conduct, there are many areas   of compliance risk that, due to their complexity, require additional   guidance. We have developed a comprehensive set of  policies and procedures  to address those risks. 
 HCA maintains an  Ethics Line  for obtaining guidance on an ethics or compliance issue or reporting     concerns. We encourage the resolution of issues at a local level     (supervisor, another member of management, Human Resources Manager or     Facility Ethics and Compliance Officer) whenever possible. However,     individuals may always contact the  Ethics Line  at: 1-800-455-1996 . 
  HCA   makes every effort to maintain, within the limits of the law and   within   the bounds of an appropriate investigation, the confidentiality   of the   identity of any individual who uses the Ethics Line. There   will be no   retribution or discipline for anyone who reports a possible   violation in   good faith.

    Welcome to Mizzouri 
    hang in there just a few seconds… we're worth the wait. 
   
   
  
 


 
 
  
  
  

 
  
   
     who's in charge here? 
      We fundamentally believe that  you are. 

      In fact, we encourage you to aggressively 
 challenge what the market research industry tells you is… 

    
      
               Reasonable we can do it  Better 
          Possible we can do it  Faster 
          Normal we can do it  Cheaper 
          
       
        
       
      
   
  
   
 
 



 
 
 
  
   we've challenged it. we've changed it. 
   Getting the answers you need to make business decisions should not be as slow, unreliable, or expensive as it is now. At Mizzouri, we’re proud members of Generation Flux — and we clearly see a market research industry that’s in desperate need of fresh new thinking. We’ve turned normal on its head. We’ve explored new business models and technologies (not to mention opportunities to disintermediate on your behalf). And we’ve created something truly disruptive in the process. 
   
    You  can  have brilliant and actionable research with global scale, incredibly fast speeds, and prices far below current market standards. 
   
  
   
             This is not about sacrificing quality. 
       Quite the contrary. At Mizzouri we’re smart about how we structure our business, how we leverage technology, how we produce our work, and how we assemble our team. 
 
      
           
    
   
   This is a business play, not a research play. 
 And it’s nothing short of a wake up-call for the market research industry. 
  
 
 
 
  
   We are a full service global market research firm. 
   But we're not like anything you've ever seen before. 
   
    We launched Mizzouri to enable clients  to commission the research they want – when they want it and the way they want to buy it. We give our clients the right information at the right time so they can make better business decisions, faster. We work with our clients, not for them. 
 And yes, we’re on a mission to disrupt the research industry. 

   
  
   
               
        Why? 
        
         Because the rules favour the industry, not the client. Because industry values are largely disconnected from clients’ needs. And, quite honestly, because this was an irresistible puzzle that we really wanted to solve. 

        
       
              After all, we've spent plenty of time on the client side - and nothing fuels disruptive innovation quite like frustration. 
   
  
 
 
 
  
   Frustration is the mother of invention 
   It was an unseasonably cold spring in London, England — and an unusually mild one in Nashville, Tennessee — when our three founding partners did something radical. They quit their jobs. They left Global COO, Board Director, and CFO roles with a mission to transform the market research industry because, quite frankly, they’d had enough. 
   
 Over the course of their careers they had all come to the conclusion that market research as it exists today should be staring extinction squarely in the eye. As former clients, they understood acutely how it feels to desperately need timely, accurate, and cost effective information to make business decisions. And after many years of asking, “ why can’t we have that? ” they came to a heady realization:  the impossible isn’t impossible after all. 
   
 The ability to triangulate is a powerful thing when you’ve got an industry in your crosshairs. And these three like-minded dissidents have enjoyed a 360° view of market research while with firms such as Procter & Gamble, TNS, The Kroger Company, Ipsos, Price Waterhouse, Gloria Estéfan Enterprises, Chiquita, Kantar, and Reba McEntire’s Starstruck Entertainment. They have always espoused disruption when it benefits the consumer (which in this case is you, the client). And when it comes to research, they firmly believe you can have all three — great, fast, and inexpensive — when the business model is right. 
   
 Call them founders of the research logistics fan club. 

  
 

 
  
   Careful what you wish for. 
   It’s one thing to ask your day-to-day suppliers to change. To demand that an entire industry change is another thing altogether. It takes bravery for clients to demand change and, equally, it will take bravery to embrace a radically different market research business model. Are you willing to move as quickly as your intuition says you can? We hope so. You have business decisions to make. 

  
 
  
   the disruptors 
   
    
   
                 
       Amazon 
       
       What can we say? Amazon completely reframed our definition of retail. We love it that they started out focused on books and nailed that before creating a truly global marketplace. Actually, it’s hard to remember life without Amazon. We’re rabidly loyal. And who knows? They may save the US Postal Service while they pursue big ambitions for mobile payments and deliveries via drones. And the idea of turning London’s Underground ticket offices into click-and-collect pickup stations? Brilliant, we say.

       One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. eBay gave us the ability to auction the shit we no longer find valuable to people who actually do, and they did it by using technology to bring the idea of collaborative consumption to the fore. Nasty Gal’s Sophia Amoruso is just one of scores of entrepreneurs who are grateful for the eBay launchpad. Which reminds us, we’ve got a snow blower that we never use any more, so if you’re interested… 
 
      
                   
       Apple 
       
       Okay, maybe “cool” isn’t always enough to win top place in the market. But taking technology innovation and wrapping it in beautiful design so that it can go viral is brilliant. They have consistently created anticipation (and demand) by rationing new innovations. Apple taught us that simple is beautiful, and we all know that simple isn’t easy. 
 
      
                   
       AirBNB 
       
       Though only around since 2008, these guys are well on their way to disrupting the global lodging industry. And the hospitality industry hates them (well, nearly as much as all those government agencies that rely on hospitality taxes). Their stats are nothing short of astounding: 9,000,000+ total guests, 34,000+ cities, 192 countries, 500,000+ listings worldwide, and if you’re counting, 600+ castles. Jeff Bezos, another one of our favourite disruptors, is an investor in this most prominent example of the Sharing Economy. They’ve used technology to reduce transaction costs, making sharing easier than ever. And they’re driving scale at a global level that no B&B (or VRBO for that matter) could ever dream of. 
 
      
                   
       Kiva 
       
       If we’re perfectly honest, what we really love about Kiva is that it takes capital away from the thugs corrupting so many geographies around the world. This microfinance marvel gives each of us the opportunity to change a life with a loan as small as $25. They’ve provided $519 million in loans so far (and counting) with a staggering 99.02% repayment rate. Grab a tissue if you plan to read a case study or two. 
 
      
                                                                 
    
   
    
     
      Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door. And in today’s chaotic new business frontier, better mousetraps are popping up everywhere. In fact, no industry — let alone any company or brand — can afford to stand still. 
   
 We’re fascinated by disruptors. Those brave souls who’ve literally replaced industry incumbents, achieved hyper-growth, driven scale, leveraged new-to-the-world business models, cut out the middle man, and applied technology to fundamentally change the human experience. 
   
 We study them closely, and here are a few of our favourites. 
     
    
                                                                       
        Netflix 
        
        A brilliantly disruptive idea that put Blockbuster out of business – though at one point a strategic decision nearly cost them their entire customer base. But they turned it around and are in a fierce battle against competitors who are much more frightening than Blockbuster ever was: Amazon, iTunes, and others. Netflix is rare in that they’ve adapted their business model and leveraged new technology to drive customer value. We’ll be watching this space closely. 
 
       
                                                                     
   
    
                                                                                 
        Google 
        
        Forget that “Google it!” is an indispensible call to action. We love any disruptor whose mantra is to be completely transformative or, in short, to go enormous or go home. And the company’s Google[x] experimental wing is exploring space-age technology that could turn healthcare on its head. Everything Google does is about massive disruption (though we’d humbly suggest they stay open to the fact that just because it’s from Google it isn’t necessarily better). But even as we type that, we realize it usually is. 
 
       
                       
        Spotify 
        
        Not much to say here, really, except that Spotify is just the latest in a long string of participants in the very public disruption of the music industry. After all, none of us will ever think about the concept of a personal music collection the same way again. We wonder where this story will end. Just in case, we’re keeping our eye on the new Beats offer. 
 
       
                       
        WhatsApp 
        
        We can just imagine the dozens – if not hundreds – of telecon executives shedding tears, pounding fists, and gnashing teeth over the stats: 430 million active users globally and more than 50 billion messages each day (which, for the record, rivals SMS levels). And these boys from Yahoo remained firm about no advertising and no gimmicks, no matter what the competition did. They were clearly onto something, because Facebook bought them for a stunning $19 billion. As for their growth over the last five years? Mark Zuckerberg put it nicely: “No one in the history of the history of the world has done anything like that.” 
 
       
                       
        Etsy 
        
        What Amazon did for retail Etsy is doing to align business interests with social and environmental responsibility. Actually, scratch that. They’re giving brick and mortar, online, and mobile retailers a run for their money even as they become one of only 521 Certified B Corporations. No question they’re leveraging technology and disintermediation to change the way independent, creative artists and curators take their goods to market. But they’re also driving incredible scale with more than 1 million active sellers worldwide (hawking over 20 million items), more than 30 million registered members, and $895 million in sales in 2012. Not bad for a company that’s only been profitable since 2009 and in existence since 2005. 
 
       
                       
        Kickstarter 
        
        Hands down. These guys were the earliest and remain the best, most successful crowdsourcing engine on the planet – and they’ve continued to evolve and increase their level of sophistication since Day 1. As for us? We can barely resist the allure of a Producer credit. 
 
       
                   
   
  
 
 
 


 
 
 
  
     This is a question of how, not what. 
   Logistics-driven market research 
   If you’ve already worked with us or have significant experience on the supplier side of market research, read no further. You already know that market research can be better, faster, and less expensive than it is today. But if you  don’t  believe it’s possible, stay with us for a moment. Keep an open mind. And understand that you’ll need to think outside the boundaries of market research for context – because you won’t find anything like it in the industry. 
   
 It’s easy to find better, faster, and cheaper solutions to just about anything now. Certainly more than any of us would have dreamed possible in the 1990s. The products we order from Amazon are exactly the same products found at any retailer, just less expensive and delivered straight to our respective front doors. The songs we download from iTunes are the same ones we’d find in a music store (had we not already stopped going to music stores) but cheaper, delivered instantly, and delivered on our terms. And with the likes of VEVO, Spotify, SoundCloud, and others on the scene, the music industry will continue its very public digital disruption while teaching a lot of other industries what  not  to do when under fire. 
   
 What we’re doing at Mizzouri is not rocket science. In fact, it’s been done in many other service industries as well. For a good look at how the model applies to law firms, click  here .  The model is smart and intuitive, but it hasn’t been leveraged in market research. It’s taken us years of working on the supplier side to fully understand why market research firms cannot and  will  not put these same principles in place. So we’ve done it ourselves, building a better mousetrap from the ground up. 
  
 

 
  
   This is how we do it...

       Technology       
      
           
  
   
          
      We do love efficiency. And disintermediation, which originated in the banking industry in the 1960s, became an efficiency force to be reckoned with by the late 1990s. Very simply, it’s about cutting out the middleman and eliminating non-value add intermediaries in a supply chain. (When was the last time you used a travel agent?) In traditional research, every hand-off across the lifespan of a project is an opportunity for mistakes, and each hand-off adds time and cost. Not only that, every time a research project moves between different supplier entities – or simply from one business unit to another within the same research firm – it gets taxed with an incremental dollop of profit. For example, a large global research firm fielding a quantitative study in three global markets sources respondents from the same sample providers that we use at Mizzouri. But the internal department responsible for finding sample must make a profit, so they mark up the external supplier’s cost. Then each of the countries executing the research marks up those costs again. And the country originating the project marks things up yet again. Clients don’t get better sample in this model, but they certainly pay a lot more for it than they need to. The Mizzouri model doesn’t include middlemen. And with fewer links in the chain, we can reduce the risk of errors, deliver results faster, and reduce costs dramatically. 
 At Mizzouri, we thoroughly enjoy helping our clients navigate from A to Z. We just don’t believe we need to stop at all 24 letters in between to get there. 
     
        
      Toyota usually gets credit for pioneering this process transformation, but the origins of just in time (JIT) inventory trace as far back as Eli Whitney and Henry Ford. The model focuses on making sure a business has exactly what it needs but only when it needs it – thereby avoiding the carrying costs and increased prices associated with extra inventory. At Mizzouri, we’ve created our internal systems and processes with this in mind. We have a deep global pool of talented researchers, industry thought leaders, marketing experts, and business professionals. And they’re all enrolled in our variable compensation model, so when they’re not working on projects they’re not part of our cost structure. 
 This model is a proverbial win-win. It provides our experts with far greater flexibility and financial upside than they’d find in a typical corporate environment. And our clients love the model because it gives them access to top industry talent around the globe (and we mean  really  top talent) without having to pay the “inventory cost” associated with having great brains on our bench. 
 The same goes for technology. At our disposal are the most advanced and innovative technology solutions available, but we choose not to acquire the companies that have built and run them. We have strong partnership agreements in place, so our clients don’t pay for the overhead associated with holding and maintaining large technology platforms in-house. An additional benefit of this approach is that we’re not forcing these partners to change their own business models to meet our needs, which keeps them focused and affordable. 
     
        
      The idea is simple: deliver precisely the product or service that a customer wants, when he wants it. The model is equally simple: build a standard pre-assembly of core modules and leave the customized bits until the end of the assembly process. (And while you’re at it, use technology to drive down costs while adding warp-speed to supply chain coordination.) Call it mass customization or late stage differentiation. The point is that it speaks to a “customer of one” and takes Built to Order to a new level. 
 Who’s doing it? Dell and HP, for starters. Who isn’t? The automotive industry as a whole. And not surprisingly, the market research industry. 
 At Mizzouri, late stage differentiation is built into our process model, and we’ve created structures that are extremely flexible and scaleable. This enables us to design unique and tailored research solutions that have high quality and low cost built in from the very beginning. Our clients don’t pay for more than they actually need. Nor are they forced to buy standard, fixed products that are expensive because they haven’t achieved economies of scale. (In car parlance, imagine the expense incurred when producing a car to meet a demand that never materializes. The same is often true for proprietary, packaged market research products; “inventory” is expensive, and someone ultimately has to pay for it.) 
 Our core – our sample engine, survey engine, programming, data processing, technology, etc. – is part of one giant pipe from the very beginning. Customization is easy, whether that’s layering on qualitative, mobile, heat mapping, conjoint, 3-D virtual fly-throughs, or any other combination of methodologies. At Mizzouri, the opportunities for customization are virtually limitless. 
     
        
      Technologists are brilliant at what they do, and they’re able to deliver breakthrough innovation. They also require specific business models to deliver that innovation. 
 We don’t try to change them or their business models. Instead, we leverage their technology expertise while providing a bridge to the market research industry. We talk to them in their language, and you can talk to us in yours. We introduce them to a new industry, and we introduce you to breakthrough new ways to answer your business questions. Without question, we don’t chase technology for technology’s sake. We leverage it to solve problems you’ve never been able to solve before – or to solve them with dramatically higher quality and lower cost. 
 It’s not our strategy to acquire these technology specialists for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that we want to keep them pure. They do what they love and you gain access to best in class thinking in an incredibly dynamic field. And because we’re not stuck with legacy systems, we can move nimbly to newer, better, and more efficient systems as they emerge. 
     
        
  
   
          
  
  
 
 
 


 
 
 
  
  
  
   
    Our Offer 
    Yes, it really is this easy. 
    We are a full service global research firm offering qualitative, quantitative, and quantilative research as well as research planning and consulting, training, and organizational development. We’re also a majority women-owned business. 
   
 What makes us different? For perspective, small research agencies and boutiques don’t have the time or capacity to deliver the breadth of capabilities required to meet 90% of a client’s research needs. So, they focus on niche offerings and (in most cases) deliver them very well. But this forces clients to know who can do what – and to work across a wide array of firms in order to meet their needs. And while many of the big guys have amassed the entire spectrum of research capabilities within their networks, those networks aren’t necessarily talking to each other. Moreover, they’re not financially incentivized to be methodologically agnostic, leaving clients to wonder if they’re  really  getting the best of the agency. 
   
 We’ve taken a very different approach. We’ve populated our Mizzouri River with top talent across a range of capabilities that we can leverage to meet nearly every client need across virtually every global geography. And this isn’t limited to traditional research. For instance, we deliver mobile surveys in developing countries, global video immersion and transcripted video databasing, 3-D animation and virtual fly-throughs for shopper research and store design, apps for updating and disseminating research findings to geographically dispersed client teams, and more. We have access to sample providers who can cover the majority of the globe. We’re quickly revolutionizing industry approaches to concept testing, advertising and communications testing, habits and practices studies, tracking, pricing and portfolio optimization, agent-based modeling, prediction markets research, gamification, and data visualization. We’re continuously improving the research tools and approaches our clients have historically used – and always through the lens of providing better, faster, more cost effective solutions. 
   
 We’re also passionate about mixed methodologies, and the number of possible combinations within our modular set of tools is virtually infinite. The key? Rapid and fluid customization, not a static suite of inflexible products. 
   
  
 

 
  
   Here are a few examples of problems we’ve recently solved for clients. 
   
    
     
     
    
   
    
             
       
        Segmentation 
        After an exhaustive qualitative exploratory, our mobile accessories client began to suspect that a new segmentation model was emerging for the category. So, they asked us to quantitatively determine the size of the new segments –  in a week, if we could . 
 We designed and executed a 10-question online quantitative survey with 1,000 demographically and geographically representative category consumers from a double opt-in panel. We delivered results in 3 days for $4,500. 
       
      
          
       
        Advertising 
        Our film promotion client wanted to understand consumer reaction to a two-minute movie trailer and supporting poster, and needed both quantitative and qualitative feedback in order to optimize the creative. 
 We designed and executed a large base online qualitative (quantilative) study with 600 target consumers from a double opt-in panel. The study included time-coded heat mapping of the creative executions in order to deliver qualitative understanding as well as statistically significant data. We delivered results in 4 days for $8,500. 
       
      
          
       
        Packaging 
        Our technology client needed new, more compelling packaging – and wanted to determine which of three design directions they should pursue based on appeal to their existing consumer segments. They also wanted to identify optimization opportunities, product pricing, source of volume, and a trade sell-in strategy. 
 We designed and executed a blended methodology  with 600 target consumers from a double opt-in panel that included large base qualitative (quantilative), a traditional quantitative survey, conjoint, and category and packaging heat mapping. We delivered results in 25 days for $70,000. 
       
      
          
       
        US Hispanic Habits & Practices 
        Our energy client needed to understand US Hispanics for the first time – their category habits and practices, their media consumption patterns, and their response to three new product concepts vis-à-vis a key competitor’s product offering. 
 We designed and executed a blended methodology study in Spanish that included large base online qualitative (quantilative) and quantitative, including concept heat-mapping. We meticulously screened 600 respondents from a double opt-in panel to remove respondents accessing the study from other countries – a massive watch-out for all US Hispanic research conducted in the US. We delivered results in 40 days for $47,000. 
       
      
          
       
        Design Evaluation 
        Our artisanal baked goods client wanted fast but actionable consumer feedback to determine which of five new logo designs to pursue as well as the pros and cons of each. 
 We designed and executed an online qualitative study with 50 target consumers that included heat-mapping to indicate positive, negative, and confusing aspects of each design (as well as qualitative rationale for the ratings). We delivered results in 3 days for $5,000. 
       
      
          
       
        Trade Sell-in Strategy 
        Our pet care client wanted to capture compelling consumer quotes to incorporate into a trade sell-in packet and that they could re-use over time for other initiatives. 
 We executed twenty, 20-minute filmed conversations with target consumers, and edited and transcribed the interviews before uploading to a searchable database where the client can create customized video clips and playlists for internal and external use. We delivered the research and the database in 21 days for $13,000. 
       
      
           
   
  
 


 
 
 
  
  
  
   
    The Mizzouri River: Our Team 
    Disruptive thinkers are powerful catalysts. They’re also a helluva lot of fun. 
    Mizzouri is home to some of the most inspiring people in the industry. Renowned experts who also happen to be extraordinary catalysts for meaningful change. Researchers, marketers, storytellers, semioticians, ethnographers, cultural anthropologists, psychologists, statisticians, business analysts, sociologists, designers – all very senior and highly regarded in their fields. And in their free time they’re authors, sailors, rock climbers, marathoners, artists, skydivers, bloggers, skiers, designers, poker players, parents, grandparents, musicians, and guerrilla gardeners. There’s a reason you won’t find newly minted MBAs or junior researchers at Mizzouri: it doesn’t fit our business model. Well-trained senior experts are methodologically agnostic and help clients find answers to their business questions more efficiently and cost effectively. They bring tremendous passion and creative problem-solving skills to the party. They enjoy flexing their research intelligence to solve enigmatic business problems. And they love what they do. If you ask us, there’s a lot to be said for that.

           Founder, CEO           Nashville USA 
          
          
           Fearless Leader indeed – though, to be clear, she bears no resemblance to the principle antagonist in the 1960s animated series. Kristin is fearless when challenging the status quo and forging brave new business territories. And without question, she is an inspiring and gifted organizational leader. It’s no wonder. This McLean, Virginia native spent 13 years at Procter & Gamble in both marketing and research roles and left as a Director after leading teams of 50+ individuals, managing research budgets in excess of $30 million, earning a reputation as a turnaround maven, and deeply impacting a broader market research organization of nearly 1,000 members. She has held CEO and Global COO posts at Ipsos and TNS in both the US and the UK, is passionately client-centric, and steadfastly believes in the transformative power of timely business intelligence. It’s not clear if her MBA from Georgetown University has anything to do with her ability to solve a Rubik’s cube with preternatural speed, but her spatial intelligence and problem-solving skills have helped more than a few clients. Ask her if she likes to cook and she’ll tell you it’s an onerous chore best left to others. She’d rather read voraciously, immerse herself in new technology, captain a sailboat off the coast of Africa, and maintain her ‘global citizen’ status (as well as her fluency in Japanese). And like her co-founders, Kristin is on a mission to transform the market research industry.

           Founder, CMO           Nashville USA 
          
          
           A rolling stone gathers no moss, they say. Stagnancy? Not even part of her vocabulary. But if Ali’s picked up anything over the course of her career, it’s momentum. And an unwavering belief that getting the right information into the hands of her clients has the power to inspire brilliance. A self-proclaimed Brand Junkie, Ali’s career has spanned market research, advertising, brand consulting, and marketing in the US and the UK – an unusual path given her degrees in International Affairs and Business – for companies including TNS, Ipsos, Foot Cone & Belding Advertising, The Kroger Company, Deskey, and Chiquita. She waxes poetic when recounting work for powerhouse brands such as Starbucks, Barclays, Coca-Cola, Disney, Microsoft, Shell, Budweiser, and McDonald’s. She obsesses over storytelling and data visualization. She wryly admits she’s spent more money moving her cat across continents than moving herself, but she figures there are far worse extravagances to be guilty of. (Like, say, exceeding her goal of visiting 20 distinct countries last year.) And after a successful career helping inspire global brands, doggedly chasing piercing insights, and turning around troubled businesses, Ali revels in her role as CMO – where she is responsible for the development of Mizzouri’s promise, offer, reputation, and unique customer experience (in addition to helping clients solve their most troubling business problems). All rumours that she is also the company prankster are grossly exaggerated.

Give him a business puzzle that requires solving the impossible and he’s a happy man indeed. And like his co-founders he is keen to disrupt the market research industry. But don’t let his background in corporate finance with firms such as Price Waterhouse fool you. Michael has also enjoyed wild success as an entrepreneur and consultant in the highly competitive US and Latin American entertainment industries, having helped household names such as Reba McEntire, Gloria Estéfan, and Shakira achieve financial success. His modeling and analytical skills have turned him into a transformation artist, and he has already developed research tools that will fundamentally change the way clients view pricing transparency from  all  their suppliers. (He’s also a highly skilled researcher.) When he’s not doting on his family, you’ll find Michael riding his bicycle on the road or his motorcycle in the dirt. And just between us, you’ll also find this musician singing to himself while he works.

                     Jill Wittman 
           Research Consultant           Geneva Switzerland 
          
          
           We love an over-achiever, especially when Innovation is her middle name. A Baltimore, Maryland native, Jill leveraged a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and an M.B.A. in Marketing & International Business to launch an impressive career – one that includes a 13-year stint at Procter & Gamble. When she left P&G, she had held senior North American and Global Consumer & Market Knowledge roles for multi-billion dollar brands such as Tide, Gain, Downy, Always, and Tampax. But Jill started in Research & Development, where her innovations for brands such as Old Spice, Secret, and Sure keep us all smelling great under pressure. The packaging evaluation and optimisation tool she helped create for Mizzouri (a big data beauty complete with conjoint, heat mapping, and large base qualitative) is Patent Pending. “Bah!” she says; “That’s nothing compared to moving a family of five to Geneva” – where, we might add, we know for a fact she’s using her Chemical Engineering background to concoct dubious new recipes for her three young children. Her parents say she was stubborn as a kid. Jill contends that she simply wielded a titanic level of perseverance. You say tomato, we say…

           KIM DEDEKER – PRINCIPAL, CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER (Cincinnati USA) 
 A quiet but powerful leader, Kim and her passion for the market research industry – and its reinvention – have inspired clients, her organizations, and agencies alike for more than 35 years. Hers is a mantra of quality. Of meaningful innovation. And of business impact. Over the course of her storied 30 years at Procter & Gamble, Kim delivered that impact to countless billion-dollar brands. She was one of the architects of the company’s Consumer & Market Knowledge organization, for which she was the global Vice President for seven years. And those who know Kim will tell you that her unparalleled dedication to growing and mentoring top talent has fundamentally changed the lives of those around her. (Not surprisingly, then, she galvanized a global account director programme that spanned 13 operating companies at Kantar, where she served as Chair of the Americas.) But don’t say we didn’t warn you. Kim’s demeanor belies a fiercely competitive nature – and she’ll gladly challenge you to a “friendly” game of HORSE in the driveway. This foodie and avid reader also speaks Spanish and French. And while she’s often tagged as “reliable,” we have it on good authority that Kim is  not  to be trusted to keep the canoe you’re sharing upright.

           Tim is the latest thing in conjoint. Actually, we think he’s the  only  thing in conjoint. We get giddy when he talks about price elasticity. And we practically swoon when he quips about Hierarchical Bayes estimation. Tim has one of those brains that we adore – and are a little afraid of. He has deep experience in marketing research statistics, including discrete choice design, analysis and simulators, segmentation, forecasting, and multidimensional scaling and correspondence maps. And he’s applied his brilliance to business problems for clients in every sector imaginable, from media and entertainment to lotteries and gaming to packaged goods and everything in between. Just for fun we asked him what he did last weekend. “Ah, I just wrote a little SAS IML code to estimate a new kind of choice model with the Gibbs sampler.” That Tim. He’s such a joker.

           A truly global citizen and gifted qualitative researcher, Claudia leads our client work in twelve Latin American countries and Spain as well as our work with US Hispanics. Small but mighty, Claudia has experience across every conceivable industry – which, when you add it all up, comes to 119 product categories and 321 brands for 267 clients. But who’s counting? Claudia is one of the most client-centric professionals we’ve ever met, and her obsession with service drives her to adopt her clients’ goals as her own. It’s a formula that works. She’s earned dozens of awards from clients such as Procter & Gamble for her ability to tackle tough business problems in tough Latin American markets. We tease her that she’s never quite sure which country she’s in (or which language she should be using). But really, we’re just jealous of all those frequent flyer miles…

           The way June tells it, when she was a little girl long, long ago and all the other kids said they wanted to be princesses or secretaries, she always told people that she wanted to be a mathematician. She didn’t just live that dream. She exceeded it – starting with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics followed by a Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology. June spent the majority of her 25-year career in market research for Procter & Gamble, where she earned a Consumer Modeling award and was an inaugural inductee into P&G’s Consumer Fellowship Society for long-term, sustained contributions to the business through market research. (She also has a patent pending for creating and using virtual marketplaces.) June is incredibly passionate about using mathematics, statistics, and psychology to uncover the stories that lie hidden in data. Her favourite client challenge? Helping them solve a business problem that they currently have no way of researching. And this gifted teacher and mentor is also well known to the TSA for her alleged habit of packing loose popcorn in her carry-on bag. But that’s probably a story best told in person.

           Research Consultant           Chicago USA 
          
          
           This global nomad and Bahrain native is one of the original Third Culture Kids, and it’s no surprise that his wife and son share the distinction. He started his 16 years at Procter & Gamble in Switzerland and followed with posts in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, England, Venezuela, and the United States. A research pioneer in far-flung former Soviet republics, Yogesh led consumer-centric global innovation efforts across multiple categories and for brands such as Pampers, Ariel, Olay, Old Spice, Crest, and Pantene before leveraging his leadership skills at both Amway and Kimberly-Clark. He feels a deep obligation to ensure that the recommendations we make based on consumer insights deliver sustainable business growth. And most comfortable when  outside  his comfort zone, Yogesh is always quick to challenge the status quo – which he can do in Gujarati, English, French, Spanish, and Hindi (though on this last point, along with the topic of his “helpfulness” in the kitchen, Yogesh’s wife is quick to passionately disagree).

           Marla has one of those rare intellects that can  bridge  – making her adept at linking research to business strategy in a way that people who are deeply analytical (or highly strategic) aren’t able to do. And this makes her even more valuable to client teams that are lean or short-staffed. She has lived and worked in the US and South Africa in senior multicultural marketing, brand management, and advertising roles for companies that include The Home Depot, Ericsson, Procter & Gamble, Bell South, Whirlpool, and the Education Corporation of America. In all cases, her data- and insight-driven strategies helped produce above average results in market. Marla loves the metaphor of Mizzouri and that our ecosystem is like a river – never still, always moving, readily transporting solutions, unleashing the power of market research. And while she holds a BS in Economics from Wharton and an MBA from the University of Michigan, Marla secretly dreams of moonlighting as a stand-up comedian. It’s just that she has an aversion to flying tomatoes.

           We want to be Mark when we grow up. No, really. He’s been the head of global consumer research for some  very  impressive properties, including MGM Resorts International, Carnival Cruise Lines, Las Vegas Sands, Carlson Restaurants, Nokia, and Motorola. And he’s walking around with a prestigious Masters of Marketing Research from the University of Georgia. Top it all off with numerous speaker appearances at industry conferences around the globe and we’re left feeling a little boring. Especially when we factor in the fact that Mark is a self-proclaimed adrenaline junkie who’s never ruled out being a private pilot, skydiver, scuba diver, or radio show host. Where will you find him when he’s not doing any of that crazy stuff? Hanging out at sporting events and live concerts, doing something aviation-oriented, or spending time with his parrot. Yes, we really did just say that.

           Sam was one of the first to raise her hand to say, “Guys, the world is changing so quickly that the market research industry is struggling to keep up.  Really  struggling.” She should know. She’s led teams from 10 to 400 in the industry, and she’s watched first hand as external suppliers have stumbled – some never getting back up. But Sam’s a change agent, and she has mastered the art of driving client value over the course of her career at companies that include Ipsos, TNS, and Schlesinger Associates. To be fair, we take a certain pleasure in knowing that this small town gal born in London, Kentucky moved to London, England (with three young children and a husband in tow, mind you) to help one of our founders turn around a troubled UK business. But we quickly give way to admiration. Because upon arriving on foreign soil with her brood, Sam discovered they’d have to spend more than a week with the five of them sleeping on one twin-size air mattress until they figured out how to take the train to Ikea. “Oh, that’s nothing. It was a great adventure and taught us that the important thing isn’t  stuff,  it’s spending time together.” To which we say CHEERS!

           The story of Grace reads like a well-loved passport: the Philippines, China, England, Taiwan, Switzerland, and the US. And these are just the places she’s lived. She has also been on site to run significant projects in Australia, Japan, Vietnam, Russia, Poland, the Middle East, and Egypt. This influential strategist leverages a disruptive and pragmatic approach to consumer, market, and competitive understanding. And over the course of her 20-year career at Procter & Gamble she gained extensive business expertise in emerging and mature markets. She also earned a reputation for being an unflappable and agile leader in times of change – brilliant qualities for anyone charged with leading billion dollar brands as well as turning around troubled businesses. She might surprise you when describing her favourite problems to solve for clients: “the Big Hairy Ones – the ones that  paralyze. ” Bravo, we say. But while this global citizen speaks English and the Tagalog and Visayan dialects of Filipino (and can command a room with harrowing tales of global adventure) she is, by her own admission, the last one in the room to get the joke. So, we just tell her when to laugh.

           It’s not surprising that Katie is a stellar research practitioner given her professional (and personal) passion for objectivity.  After starting her career as a biochemist for the Medical University of South Carolina, Katie spent nearly ten years at Procter & Gamble, where she had responsibility for all facets of market research. This is also where she honed her ability to render complex data into simple yet strategic and actionable business recommendations. Katie became recognized globally as one of P&G’s few shopper experts in the e-Commerce and Omnichannel spaces, and her unique brand of business tenacity delights clients to this day. We find it hilarious that this travel buff and fun-seeker is also somewhat accident-prone. So, when we’re comparing notes after a long weekend, it’s always Katie we want to hear from first.

                     Dr. Simon Lidington

           Simon is, at his most visceral core, an entrepreneur. Once acquiring his BA (Honours) and Master’s degrees from Exeter University, he launched his career in policy research for the Manpower Services Commission. He followed this with a series of senior positions at Fiat, PAS Research, and BJM Research. And he was only 31 when he set up the first of his four new companies. Simon is credited with being the brand transformation architect who helped Skoda move from 24 th  to 1 st  on JD Power in just three years, and as the Chairman and CEO of Research International UK he transformed the business into a client-centric powerhouse. But it’s his Big Sofa insights and video databasing offer that is disrupting the way clients like Audi, Barclays, British Airways, Unilever, Tesco, and Volkswagen think about co-creation, searchable video content, insight development, and knowledge bank creation. Because of all this, we forgive Simon for being an accomplished swanee whistle player (though we relish the nearly endless opportunities to tease him about this dubious feat of musical prowess).

           Research Consultant           Cincinnati USA 
          
          
           Born in a small village in Germany, Guenter has lived in Beijing, Hong Kong, Geneva, Moscow, and Cincinnati, has travelled throughout Siberia as well as other distant parts of the globe, and speaks five languages. If you ask us, that qualifies him as a truly global citizen. Over the course of his 13-year career in Marketing with Procter & Gamble he delivered breakthrough innovations in beauty care in North America, doubled Tide sales in Russia, tripled soap sales in the Ukraine, and convinced pet owners throughout Western Europe that Bounty was the best product to clean up their furry friends’ messes. Ask him what he loves to do for clients and he’ll tell you it’s quite simple: help them make money – something he’s doing now with digital content creation, search engine optimization, and social media management. And as you’d expect from any over-achiever, Guenter’s personal interests run the gamut, from running to playing the piano to conducting choirs. We certainly took notice when he passed his advanced sommelier exam. Needless to say, we’re passing the wine list to him every time.

           Truth be told, we have a bit of a crush on Matt (when we’re not distracted by being a little in awe of him). He’s an experienced researcher, consultant, and strategist. And he is particularly interested in organizational systems and cultures – as well as getting to the heart of why people do what they do. Matt’s colleagues would say he’s committed, strategic, grammatically demanding. Matt will just tell you he moved from West Yorkshire to London for the weather and that he’s happy hanging out with his family, swimming, playing low quality guitar, and sitting in a chair staring into space. It’s that last bit that gets us because we know he’s  always  thinking. He’s led brand and organizational work for BT, Renault, Audi, and The Economist. He’s brilliant at cutting through noise and clutter to achieve strategic or tactical clarity. He is, in his own words, a Mizz-ionary with verve. Bravo.

           Andrew has served as Chief Technology Officer, software architect, developer, systems programmer, and (our personal favourite) webmaster for a variety of companies, including Culligan International, GMT, NogginLabs, and New Consumer Solutions. We’ve never met anyone knows his way around website development, navigation, SEO, or database application development quite like Andrew – so we really only hear beeps and boops when he starts to speak CSS, PHP, MySQL, HTML, AJAX, C#, ASP, NET 3.0, and a host of other acronyms that belong squarely in the middle of a Meeting Bingo sheet. This native of the mean streets of Connecticut is a seasoned entrepreneur and an avid foodie. He speaks English, Spanish, and Sarcasm and is the last person you want to be with if you’re planning to break any rules. You see, Andrew  always  gets caught.

           Research Consultant           Cincinnati USA 
          
          
           Sarah is one of those people we don’t come across very often: a master researcher who spent 14 years as an  intrapreneur  at Procter & Gamble. And without question, spending that much time in rarified upstream air for brands such as Pantene, Olay, Gillette, and Tide honed skills that so many of our clients need as they tackle innovation: new product development, business model creation, opportunity mapping, and delivery of consumer “wow”. Sarah is happiest when she’s creating breakthrough approaches to identify disruptive product and service ideas – and she’s just as comfortable in durable goods and healthcare as she is in consumer packaged goods. She’s also a highly creative and prolific writer, and has been an Elite Yelper for more than five years. All of which leaves us scratching our heads. How is it possible that someone who can so clearly see the path to business success has such a notoriously poor sense of direction? Suffice it to say that we’re in charge of the maps on business trips.

           Isabelle still remembers what a retiree said to her at a Procter & Gamble gathering nearly 30 years ago when she started with the company: “Now that my career is over,” he said, “it’s not the work I remember, it’s the people.” And Isabelle, too, has made people a key focus throughout her entire career – driving her to earn her MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) certification. As a qualitative expert and senior leader in Market Research for P&G’s European business, she worked in the Beauty Care, Pharmacy, Hair Care, and Personal Cleansing categories, all of which has given her the foundation to lead complex initiatives and serve as an internal consultant for clients. Where will you find her in her free time? If she’s not soaking up the natural beauty of parks across Europe she’s curled up with chocolate and a great cup of tea. You  won’t,  however, find her anywhere near the kitchen. Her disasters are (apparently) the stuff of legends. We’d just as soon share her chocolate anyway.

           If you look up Shopper & Retail Strategy in the dictionary, Lynette’s photo will be curled up right next to the definition. Over the course of her storied career at Procter & Gamble she became the architect of the company’s retail strategy, elevating the conversation and helping craft strategic partnerships between P&G and no less than the top 20 retailers in North America – growing both sides in the process. She has a visceral understanding of qualitative and quantitative research, consumers and customers, initiative management and forecasting, in-market testing, and macro analysis. She’s as comfortable managing a $30M research budget as she is shuffling her two children from one activity to another. But we love it most when this visionary wags her finger at us and reminds us that data is exponentially more abundant than ever and the consumer’s voice continues to get stronger…now is not the time to take anything for granted. And market research is nothing less than a  way of thinking .

           This former Chief of Analytics and Methodology for Copernicus and other leading edge market research firms has literally led more than 500 research studies in virtually every product and service category leveraging every quantitative methodology available to marketers. And we’re not kidding: segmentation, targeting, multivariate methodologies, new product testing, forecasting, concept optimisation, advanced analytics, database modeling, market structure analysis, data interpretations, and strategic planning. He’s also a regular speaker and author on the AMA and ANA circuits. So, you might not guess that Henry loves working with a new, dynamic, “rebel” company that’s happy to challenge the status quo. And you’d certainly never guess that this Baltimore native once performed a dueling Elvis karaoke routine alongside a co-worker in requisite white Elvis jumpsuits. We’re not even sure what to do with that bit of information, but now that it’s in our heads we’re going to make sure it’s in yours, too.

           Business Consultant           London UK 
          
          
           Nick wins the prize for being our most global of brand gurus. Forget the fact that this London native has also lived in Turkey, Slovakia, Hungary, and, Lithuania. He actually led projects on six continents in 2013 – and we’ve long since lost count of the number of countries. That aside, Nick’s passion for brands is irrepressible and he has a unique ability to add value through his contributions to planning, analysis, and implementation of business growth strategies. Importantly, he knows that brand and brand growth are at the heart of every business – and that plans are only meaningful if client teams can actually make them happen. Nick viscerally understands the client experience, having worked for companies such as SABMiller and Rothmans. And in a consultant capacity he has worked with clients such as Hershey, Novartis, Lloyds Bank, Nokia, Mars, Heineken, Unilever, SCA, and Treasury Wine Estate. He merrily recounts his experience helping launch Tampax in Saudi Arabia using a male sales force (and where the product demonstration training was memorable, to say the least). Always one to go the extra mile for a client, Nick admits that he once did an “unofficial” gin brands product demonstration for the first class cabin on a long haul British Airways flight. Given that he’s a self-proclaimed world-class martini maker and drinker, we’re not entirely convinced that his motives were pure. Cheers, Nick!

           A gifted research manager and data analyst with over 12 years’ experience in marketing, non-profit, public policy, and mental health research, Maricelly is a force to be reckoned with when she tucks into a juicy business challenge. Leveraging a B.A. in Government & International Studies and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration & Public Policy, she started her career teaching and leading research for the University of Missouri, Southern Illinois University, and Washington University. She has also held senior research roles at Freddie Mac and the American Red Cross – where she collaborated with clients to decrease the average turnaround time of episodic disaster-related research. This Brazil-born observer of the human condition admits that love and knowledge have moved her to her many global homes. She jokes that chasing after three “Bra-talians” (her daughters) is no easy task, and that she and her Italian husband have a very loud household indeed. Her innate joie de vivre is contagious – and there’s nothing quite like watching Maricelly help clients bring structure to their ideas and use it to inform their strategies.

           If you’ve kept all your back issues of  Advertising Age  and  PR Week  you’ll find Beau there. She led a team of PR agencies, brand marketers, and market mix modelers to develop a measurement and optimization tool to understand the effectiveness of Procter & Gamble’s PR spend. Not surprisingly, it was front-page news. Beau also created P&G’s segmentation and targeting capability – but her real strength is her ability to leverage all of her experience at P&G, which spanned market research, marketing, finance, and accounting. She’s a Grove-trained strategic facilitator. She’s a whiz at helping define her clients’ business problems clearly. She’s passionate about servant leadership and helping individuals grow to be their best. And when she’s not digging into a hefty stack of existing research to find the piercing insight, you’ll find her in her car, driving her son to music lessons, band practice, show rehearsals, and competitions.

           Iris’ experience on the client side for Procter & Gamble (and agency side with Ipsos) positions her beautifully to help clients who want to understand and succeed in the critical Chinese market. Over the course of her 16 years in market research, Iris has worked in categories such as Laundry, Food & Beverage, Fem Care, Personal Cleansing, and Hair Care. She takes a holistic approach to her work and is extremely skilled in integrating data from various sources to find business answers as well as passionately pursue her clients’ business growth – both of which certainly helped her earn Ipsos’ annual  Best Client Service Award .

                     Jay Hunt 
           Video Ethnographer           London UK 
          
          
           There are many times when the magic in the data – when the truth of the consumer’s voice – can only be brought to life in video. And for that, clients need a gifted TV and Digital executive producer with expertise in scripting, development, producing and directing, and leading creative teams. That person is Jay. Born in Windsor UK in the shadow of the Queen’s castle, she resides in London (but longs for the sunshine, sushi, and smoothies of Los Angeles). We’re all a bit in awe of her career, over the course of which she’s been a Development Executive for the BBC, Betty TV, and ITV. She’s been a Series Producer for BBC One’s  The Vanessa Show  and SKY1’s  Hotter Sex  (on the heels of SKY1’s  Naked in Westminster ). And just when we thought it couldn’t get more interesting, Jay tells us she’s also been a Celebrity Booker for BBC’s  Comic Relief 5  and has manned the Showbiz Desk for the Daily Mail. Her current clients range from The Prime Minister of the UK to RBS to Ogilvy to Stonewall to Mars. What makes her brilliant? Always having a Plan B for clients with smaller budgets. In her free time she watches movies, reads fashion blogs, and hangs out with horses. By her own admission she’s rubbish at singing and drawing, but she’s a bloody good horse rider, a brilliant conversationalist, and a very loyal friend. In short, she’s our kinda gal.

           Christian joined Mizzouri after an inspiring 18-year career at Procter & Gamble, where he helped us all stay clean (and blissfully free of dust bunnies) thanks to his work launching Swiffer and his leadership on Tide, Pantene, Dawn, Lenor, Cascade, Iams, Ariel, and a host of other brands in the US, Belgium, and Switzerland. He has also lived in Singapore and Sweden, and this global explorer is addicted to podcasts like Stuff You Should Know, Radiolab, and Freakonomics. He’s like that. He treats his brain like a toolbox that he fills with random and seldom used tools that will surely come in handy someday – and as it turns out, he’s gifted at pulling disparate but critical bits of information together for clients. We joke that he’s the Google engine of Mizzouri. Except that he does far more than just serve up answers. He serves up compelling business recommendations.

           An entrepreneurial streak seems to run through most of the Mizzouri team, and Kristi is no exception. She started her first company (an on-campus video rental store) when she was in college. Her second venture was a smartphone app technology that analyzed moles for characteristics of melanoma skin cancer – a business that was acquired just a year after launch. But don’t be fooled; Kristi is also a classically trained market researcher who spent six years with Procter & Gamble. While there, she led initiatives all over the world (including work with low income consumers in emerging markets), and along the way uncovered unique insights about the male shopper that helped drive significant incremental growth for Gillette and Old Spice brands (and earned her a President’s Award). Her current passion? Leveraging her proprietary technology to enable clients to find the information they need in their existing data in  seconds , not hours. Indeed, something that moves as quickly as Kristi does.

           There are very few researchers who can say that their consumer insight generation work helped a brand launch from scratch and quickly capture the greatest share in the category. Lena can. Over the course of her 18-year career with Procter & Gamble in Greater China she has led market research initiatives in Laundry, Skin Care, Beauty Care, and Fem Care – and now boasts 10+ years of skincare experience in China. She leverages her expert quantitative and qualitative skills to round out her research findings and help clients succeed in this critical business market.

           Koga is obsessed with helping global clients lower the risk of their business decisions (and avoid failure) by leveraging critical market and consumer data. He also strongly believes that political and social factors are not to be ignored, and he has deep expertise in public opinion and political polling research in addition to more than 15 years of commercial research experience. Kogo knows his sub-Saharan region well – and even served as the principal statistician in the Biometrics Departments in the Ministry of Agriculture before spending several years with Gallup International. He and his partners lead and conduct our research in 13 sub-Saharan countries, including Zimbabwe, Malawi, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Angola, DRC, South Africa, Tanzania, Swaziland, and Madagascar. And while it’s bad enough that Koga leaves us in the dust with his skills in applied mathematics, he leaves us speechless when he starts talking statistics.

           Research Consultant           Washington DC USA 
          
          
           Over the course of her six-year career at Procter & Gamble, Lauren didn’t just master brand-building fundamentals, learning plan development and execution, qualitative, and quantitative methodologies such as market mix modeling, in-store marketing testing, and media effectiveness tracking. She also leveraged her shopper expertise to lead adoption and deployment of a First Moment of Truth tool in North America that has helped P&G deliver with excellence in-store. And she rounded out her extensive work in P&G’s coffee and dish care categories by leading the company’s largest multi-brand effort at the 2012 London Olympics. We expect a driven researcher like Lauren to be an over-achiever in all aspects of her life, and she certainly doesn’t disappoint. This mother, marathon runner, and certified yoga instructor has also trained and certified one of her dogs as a Therapy Dog. But for Lauren, all roads lead back to market research. Her husband is in market research (as are the majority of her friends), so dinnertime conversations often revolve around anticipated Purchase Intent lift based on optimized POS materials. What a rebel.

           After a start at United Biscuits in Trade Marketing, Fred went on to spend much of his 20 plus year career working with (and for) creative agencies including McCann Erickson, JWT, LIVE, Haygarth, and Exposure. After repeatedly stumbling over a persistent knowledge gap in the industry, he began specializing in retail activation based on insight across multiple channels. As a result, clients such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Diageo, Tesco, Samsung, and Procter & Gamble rely on Fred’s expertise to deliver retail activation founded on insight and strategy. And we admire his can-do spirit – which isn’t solely exemplified by his backpack trips across far-flung parts of Africa, South America, and Asia. Nope, Fred once found himself locked inside a Spanish toilet right before a big client pitch but deftly launched himself over the transom and made it to the meeting on time. Funny, we’re still so busy laughing that we don’t even remember who won that one.

           It’s not often you find a technology expert who fully understands both the agency and the client perspective, but Christian is one of those rare individuals. For the agency, it’s about finding the right operations software, mobile data collection software, and reporting software. For clients, it’s more about collaboration software, insights management, and online reporting. Regardless, it takes the ability to hear what an organization actually needs even when it’s not overtly stated – and the ability to combine solutions to create what’s right for each situation. That’s where magic happens. And because Christian spent over 25 years with Ipsos in senior global IT roles that were always client facing, he knows how to derive maximum value from technology in a scalable, global way. This highly published New Orleans native revels in the prospect of massive change in the industry, and will giddily tell you that decades of survey-based methods are being disrupted by tech and the Internet of Things. But then he’ll also tell you that his jambalaya is second to none – and we can vouch for that.

           Though arguably still early in her career, Hilari has garnered impressive experience through her role at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in New York (where she developed competitive retail analysis and planned, prepared, and styled events at the MSLO offices) as well as her work with clients such as The Home Depot, The Green Bay Packers, Tostito’s, Michael’s Crafts, Volvo, and Hershey. A graduate of Vanderbilt University with a B.S. in Organizational Development and a Masters in Leadership & Organizational Performance, Hilari is also a nationally recognized lifestyle blogger. (She’s also a dangerous and prolific baker, to which our ever-expanding waistlines can attest.) She is a master of organization – something that serves her clients well when she’s the one breaking their complex projects into manageable pieces with clear structure. What you might never learn outside a game of Truth or Dare is that Hilari was a professional figure skater for 15 years. And we’re convinced that 15 years of 4AM practices accounts for the fact that she’s always the first one in the office.

           Project Coordinator           Nashville USA 
          
          
           Barrett’s career follows a clear and consistent theme of client service. She has held Account Executive roles for The Voice-Tribune, Rebecca Ruth Candies, and Dot Fox – all the while leading funding development, event planning, and ticket sales for numerous non-profit entities. This highly driven Louisville native is a proud Derby, bourbon, and bluegrass lover who’s happy to remind us that Jennifer Lawrence, Hunter S. Thompson, and My Morning Jacket all hail from her hometown. A few years ago, Barrett secured a rare (and highly coveted) spot in NYC’s New School for Drama  Summer Immersion Experience , which is just one in a long list of adventures that includes navigating the treacherous Wild River Range in Wyoming before summiting the Grand Teton. When she’s not helping to lead our efforts in video databasing, you’ll find Barrett practicing Ashtanga yoga, philosophizing with friends over Lagunitas IPA, and belting out Brandi Carlile. (And usually in that order.)

We’ll convince him… The most global of our Nashville team, Gonzalo has lived, studied, and worked in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, China, Turkey, France, Germany, and the US. He speaks Spanish, English, French, and Mandarin. And as if  that  weren’t enough to intimidate us, his experience as a consultant and analyst in Shanghai has given him a tremendous understanding of the social media, communication, and marketing strategies that are invaluable for companies interested in expanding to China. (How did he end up there, you ask? Simple: he finished his master’s, bought a one-way ticket to Shanghai, and kept his fingers crossed.) Gonzalo holds a B.A. in Political Science from Davidson College and a Masters in Advanced European & International Studies from the Centre Internationale de Formation Européenne. And when he’s not eating BBQ or complaining about the Dolphins, you’ll find him eating BBQ and complaining about the Dolphins.

                     Liz Blue 
           Cognitive Neuroscience Research Associate           Nashville USA 
          
          
           Ask Liz what she’s passionate about and she’ll quickly answer, “Applying neuroscience in order to understand cognition and deliver better research.” She’s not kidding. This Certified Advanced Brain Trainer holds a Masters degree with merit in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Essex in Colchester, England. She has established EEG correlates involved in unconscious brand priming and its effect on conscious motivation, behaviour, and decision. She has collected, scored, and analyzed data. She has refined experimental procedures – and along the way she has gained significant understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of research through her own study of research on prospective and associative memory, the neural correlates of emotion processing, prospective memory, recognition memory, source monitoring, and cued recall. She’s even trained to independently operate the electroencephalogram (EEG) and interpret the data. All of which makes our heads hurt. But we do take comfort in the fact that she’ll give Kim Dedeker a run for her money on that “friendly” game of HORSE, since Liz played D1 basketball in college.

             About Us  
             Edwin  
             B. Raskin Company has been in the real estate business  
             since 1954. We invite you to consider how the services  
             we provide can enhance the performance and value of  
             your property.   
             Raskin has built an  
             exceptional track record for successful management,  
             sales and leasing of multi-family and commercial properties.  
             Our designation as an  Accredited   Management   
              Organization  by the Institute of Real Estate  
             Management reflects our commitment to the highest standards  
             of integrity, financial stability, education and experience.  
              
             Through the years,  
             our innovative approach to the management of income  
             producing properties has achieved significant results  
             for our clients including many institutions such as  
             Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.   
             Assigning a Raskin  
             property manager to oversee each property is just the  
             beginning of the management process. Our concept of  
             effective property management extends far beyond the  
             obvious. Certainly, the rent is collected. Utilities  
             paid. Cash flow optimized. Curb appeal and a hundred  
             other essential details are seen to with matchless efficiency.  
             But it's in other not-so-routine tasks that our years  
             of experience give you a decided edge: Evaluating insurance  
             needs and premiums. Reviewing assessments with an eye  
             to lowering taxes when possible. Counseling on mortgage  
             financing. Adjusting casualty losses. Contracting major  
             renovations. In short, treating your property as if  
             it were our own.   
             We take special pride  
             in the performance and reliability of our sophisticated  
             accounting operation. Our staff is expert at producing  
             detailed financial information that responds effectively  
             to the individual requirements of each client. During  
             the first week of each month, Raskin clients receive  
             a cash flow statement including detailed budget variations  
             highlighting their property's performance. An in depth  
             series of financial reports and a comprehensive analysis  
             of property performance will be received shortly thereafter.  
             Raskin  
             sales and leasing staff has a high volume, solid track  
             record of success. Whether you have an office building,  
             shopping center or other commercial property, you can  
             count on us for the kind of response that will generate  
             maximum performance and value.  
             We'll develop a management  
             plan to meet your goals. Each of us at Raskin is focused  
             on giving your property and money the same care and  
             attention we would give our own, because we understand  
             that that's the only way to achieve the kind of results  
             that clients expect.   
             We will give you our  
             commitment to handle your real estate needs with professionalism  
             and integrity. Let us put our four decades of experience  
             to work for you. Consider our past when you plan your  
             future.

                                     Your hospital is under siege.  
 Managed-care payor hassles. Denied or delayed commercial-carrier claims. Overdue accounts due to complex coding and billing. Lack of top-quality local human resources. Reduced payment levels from all government payors. All these forces tax your staff, waste your resources, and undermine your profit.  
 Where to turn? Citadel Outsource Group. By outsourcing key business-office financial services, you gain immediate access to the kind of knowledge, experience and support enjoyed by only the top medical centers in major markets. All for less than you’re paying now.  
 Need access to cash? We’ve spent years streamlining the third-party billing process, including Medicare and Medicaid. We can quickly convert your older accounts into cash; in fact, we recover millions every year for our clients.  
 For greater control, choose full or partial outsourcing of your entire Patient Financial Services department. Backed by state-of-the-art technology, our highly trained personnel work seamlessly with your other divisions to provide superior service at a lower cost.

 Testimonial 
 \"A topnotch billing company is essential to the financial success of 
any anesthesiology practice. They should work as hard at collecting our 
money as we did generating it. While changing our billing from in-house 
to ABS, that is precisely what we have found. Whether billing OR cases, 
pain clinic or our large volume ICU practice, their service and 
commitment to us has exceeded our expectations. E & M coding and 
billing is now hassle free. Call them like I did at 6:00 pm on a Friday 
night and have the boss pick up the phoneâ€¦.that is work ethic you can 
count on.\"

         Stroke: Truths vs. Myths 
          
         
                
        April 16, 2015 
         
                       
        True or False? If you’re young, you don’t need to worry about having a stroke. False, says Dr. Denise Miller with Menorah Medical Center. Age is just one of many myths surrounding stroke. Dr. Miller explains how knowing the facts can help you better identify the risks and maybe even save a life. 
         
                      
                         
         
          
         Time Critical in Reacting to Stroke Diagnosis 
          
         
                
        April 16, 2015 
         
                       
        Missouri’s new Time Critical Diagnosis (TCD) emergency care response system will provide stroke patients – even those in rural areas around Kansas City – quicker access to life-saving treatment. Dr. Erik Petersen with Centerpoint Medical Center explains how the TCD System designation combined with existing Primary Stroke Care Center accreditation is providing unparalleled emergency care. 
         
                      
                         
         
          
         This Woman is Having a Stroke. Would You Know What to Do? 
          
         
                
        April 2, 2015 
         
                       
        Knowledge is power when it comes to stroke.

Here are some tips to reduce your risk. We also encourage you to take our free online stroke risk assessment. 
         
                      
                         
         
          
         Preventive Surgeries Among Women Following in Wake of Genetic Cancer Testing 
          
         
                
        March 25, 2015 
         
                       
        After testing positive for the BRCA gene in 2011, oncology nurse Kelly Boling at Research Medical Center – like Angelina Jolie - underwent a mastectomy and had her ovaries removed – a move that her doctor, Stephanie Graff, oncologist a HCA Midwest Health, says can reduce the risk of cancer by up to 85 percent.

We have that trust in Hiscall and we value the relationship.” DeWayne Olive | Executive Vice President & CFO | F&M Bank

 “Doing what they say, meeting their deadlines. That to me is something that they are head and shoulders above a lot of other people that I’ve dealt with.” Terry Sheppard | Director IT Department | Tennessee Health Management 
 “Hiscall is a customer service driven company. They separate themselves from everybody else. I wish everybody else had the customer service that Hiscall has. They’re cost conscious. They’re not trying to sell you the biggest, greatest thing, but trying to sell you what you really need and what you’re going to need for the future that’s expandable. It was so comforting when we finally switched over and got Hiscall.” Jeff Yeomans | CFO | Generations ObGyn 
 “We had a construction project going on out here. The contractor cut a 100 pair cable and our main phone lines coming in. Hiscall and Gary responded quickly. In fact, Gary was in the ditch with us at 2 o’clock that morning.” Russ Taylor | Director Support Services | Cumberland Heights 
 “We’ve been doing business with Hiscall for about 15 years. The quality of service and the added value they bring to the table has been superior. I have really been codependent on their relationship as far as their advice and the strategic planning that they offer us and taking Covenant to the next level with our technology.” Angie Ingle | Telecommunication Supervisor | Covenant Health

The products, service and support that they provide, cannot be beat. They are known throughout the industry for their honesty and integrity. It is very rare to find a business partner these days, that stands behind a mission statement that includes Christian ethics.

                                         Q. How is InfoWorks different from other places you have worked? 
 A.  InfoWorks not only cares about its employees but also the employee’s family. InfoWorks takes thoughtful measures to let people within the organization know that they care.

                                         Q. Favorite thing about InfoWorks? 
 A.  The people. I’m lucky enough to work with both clients and colleagues who I would consider friends.

                                         Q. What is the best part about your job? 
 A.  The best part about my job is the variety of my experiences which are always changing. Working for a consulting firm lets me work with a variety of industries and people. Each project is always different. There are so many diverse industries in the Nashville area. Working with each of them, building relationships, and learning my way around them is a fun and sometimes challenging experience.

                                         Q. How would you describe your position? 
 A.  I primarily work to build relationships; whether that is with our consultants to help understand their skill-sets and interests to get them involved on the correct projects, or around Nashville by finding companies that might be in need of InfoWorks’ assistance.

                                         Q. What was your first project at InfoWorks? 
 A.  When I first started at InfoWorks I helped out on several small projects before the perfect project came up. I worked with a small pharmacy company that provided medications to jails and wanted to upgrade their technology to include inventory and medication administration documentation. I was able to use a variety of past experiences in supply chain, corrections, electronic health records, training, software documentation and clinical workflows. It was a fun project!

                                         Q. What does it mean to you to be an owner? 
 A.  For me, being an owner means taking responsibility to the next level—I expect more from myself and my coworkers because we are all personally invested in the success of InfoWorks both financially and culturally. I’m more likely to do the little things like clean up a spill in the kitchen, or go the extra mile to make sure my code not only works but is designed well.

      Let's suppose the saying \"knowledge is power\" is true. So then, one might deduce that powerful knowledge comes from experience. Great. We agree then. Welcome aboard. Our top-secret strategy here at iostudio is to find talented and interesting people, put them in a room together and see what happens. So far, what's come out of it are bigger and smarter ideas. Because the one thing we do have in common is we're problem solvers at the core. What does all this hullabaloo mean? We’d like to think it means companies are finding more success. And that today there are better ideas out there in the world than there were yesterday. So we're going to keep on staying interesting, and keep on doing interesting things.

           TAP THE HUGE SLEEP LAB MARKET 
               Over 70 million Americans have an undiagnosed sleep disorder 
                  and should be tested. Currently there are a limited number of 
                  sleep test labs operating in the US. In fact, if all of the 
                  existing sleep laboratories operated at 100% capacity every 
                  day of the year, they would only be able to test 6% of the available 
                  market during that time.

               ANOTHER SUCESSFUL ROLLOUT 
      
               W e recently installed 
            the EEG (electroencephalograph) segment of our proprietary system 
            in three client hospitals. The EEG data collection, processing and 
            reporting are very similar to our Sleep Disorders Testing service. 
            Our clients are reporting tremendous satisfaction with the significant 
            improvement in ease of use while continuing to rely on our standard 
            same-day turnaround time for results. Some of the improvements include 
            software that automatically uploads patient files for processing and 
            downloads reports when they are ready. And, of course, all of the 
            HIPAA safeguards in place for our sleep program apply to EEG. The 
            improvements weâ€™ve made in our system exemplify our ongoing 
            commitment to quality.

 One night my girlfriend and I found ourselves scrambling to find care for our five-month-old puppy. The knowledgeable and warm staff  provided us not only the care we neededâ€š but did so in a timely mannerâ€š with a caring heartâ€š and presented us with the utmost professionalism in vet care I have ever experienced.    ~ Josh R.

 Experience & Excellence in Veterinary Medicine: PetMed 
 
 
   
    
    
    Can't ask for better veterinary care than what your pet will receive at Pet Med. Dr. Girone is a gifted doctor - and has seen my pets through the best of times as well as those in between. (15+ years) Caring and competent staff ... Highly recommend!
     -Traci Bryant 
    

    
    I having been taking my furry friends to PetMed for over 10 years. The vets and staff having always given my guys the best of care.
     -Karen Pilkay 
    

    
    I have been taking my pets to PetMed since Harvie recommended them in 2008 for Marcus. This week, Buddy had an accident and tore the crucial tendon and miniscus in his knee. I have never been treated with such respect and compassion as a dog owner in addition to getting the absolute best care for Buddy. They took the time to discuss the options, made sure he was comfortable. The prices are fair and the service is outstanding. I would absolutely recommend this vet to everyone.
     -Jules Funderburk 
    

    
    I have used PetMed since I moved to Nashville and LOVE it there. When I had to put one of my cats to sleep they knew how much it upset me and let me come back another week to pay for it since I was so upset. They even called the next day to make sure I was ok and sent me a card. I'm glad you have had great experiences there!
     -Jessica Caine 
    

    
    The folks at PetMed are like family. They love your animals as if they were their own. They are friendly and professional and sadly even though I lost a pet, they were there for me and my family the entire time. My dog when boarded never wants to leave and is always excited to go because he knows how much he is loved.
     -Jenny Lynn Sterrett 
    

    
    Everyone at Pedmed will take really good care of your furry friends. They are so helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The doctors go out of their way to make sure your pet is comfortable & healthy.
     -Mendy Caldwell 
    

    
    Would NOT go anywhere else. The staff are professional, knowledgeable and care deeply about the health and welfare of your pet. If you are looking for the best care for your beloved companion, PetMed is the place to go!
     -Patty Wilson 
    

    
    We LOVE Pet Med. They are the vet for my cat and I also board her there when we go on long trips. I've never had an issue and they treat her like their family. Beyond amazing.
     -Becca Sanborn 
    

    
    We have 3 dogs and 1 cat and we have taken them to PetMed for close to 6 years now. The office is very clean and well kept, the staff and Dr's are friendly and helpful and the prices are reasonable. There have been numerous occasions where they have gone above and beyond to help us out. I would highly recommend this Vet office to everybody. The location is convenient and I know you will be happy with your experience!

    Do you want to retain control of your hospital?   


   
    With health reform, hospitals need QHR even more -- to stay ‘lean and mean’ and maintain quality.

         Operations Experience 
    
  
   

   
    

 
  
  
                 QHR is experience in action. Managing more than 700 hospitals over the past three decades, we’ve learned how to innovate with our hospital operations and consulting services. 
         
 
   
    Operations Experience   

   
     Still going strong after 35 years, QHR is among the top healthcare consulting firms in America.   
 What makes us different from other consulting firms? It’s those three decades of hands-on hospital operations. We see hospitals holistically. And respond to your challenges with a multidisciplinary approach.   
 Performing 800 consulting engagements each year - from short term focused initiatives to radical turnarounds - we live and breathe sustainable improvement. Helping hospitals thrive: that’s our success.    
 QHR offers an incomparable local, regional, national perspective for hospitals and physician practices.

                 Our unique healthcare consulting and advisory experience, insights and tools help you improve strategic, operational and financial performance.  
         
 
   
    Measurable Results   

   
     QHR strategists help you discover opportunities to launch new revenue streams. Our benchmarking and management tools refine your execution. The QHR Learning Institute enhances the skills of nearly 15,000 hospital professionals annually. And the Quorum Purchasing Advantage can help our hospitals save 5-8% more than other group purchasing programs offer.    
 
 
   
    
 

   

 
  
         Measurable Results 
    
  
   

   
    

 
  
  
                 QHR operations clients outperform peer hospitals in quality and financial measures and receive recognition as top hospital performers and among the best places to work in healthcare. 
 
         
 
   
     

   
    Client Value   

   
     Year after year, we give our clients valuable management support, strategic experience and cost savings tools. Renewals prove it: the average age of our management contract is 21 years.  
   
 That edge helps them - and our consulting clients - preserve autonomy. Independently or in the context of strategic affiliations, we help you grow a stronger future.

                The collaborative plan we developed with QHR is truly ingrained in our culture today. QHR provided us with the knowledge and expertise to gather the right data, analyze service line viability and accelerate the entire process.

                Having QHR on our side has been invaluable to our hospital’s ICD-10 implementation process. QHR developed an ICD-10 implementation roadmap unique to our needs, equipping us with the education and tools so that our transition to ICD-10 is seamless.

                It is impossible for a small or even a medium hospital to keep up with government regulations and still run a business.  With health reform, hospitals will need QHR resources even more to stay ‘lean and mean’ while maintaining quality.

                     I would like to take the time to say a big THANK YOU to your company and staff for being available to us. I have always had positive results with your staff, but must highly praise Kyle Good. He is always very nice but was extremely patient with us on 
this particular day as we added on three  
X-Rays 
during his visit.  
I just wanted to make sure we acknowledge Kyle and his great attitude!

                         Jo Dee Messina to release new album March 18!  
                      
                         Release Date: March 18 (Dreambound Records)What You’ll Hear: Early on you’ll recognize this is a breakup album filled with her usual feisty playfulness. For happily married Messina, it’s newfound freedom from a label that make Me her most personal album to date. She wrote or co-wrote many of twelve tracks and let fans not only decide the title, but invited them to what became the 15th largest funded music campaign in Kickstarter.com history. Rock out to “Not Dead Yet” and “Take It,” and gussy up with girl power in “A Woman’s Rant” and “Me.” For all those moments when you want to get loud, shake off the haters and breathe a little fire—Messina’s sentimental and sassy fifth album is just the thing.

         Earth Day was observed on April 22nd at Mountains Branch Library with an afterschool Children’s “Lorax” Program. In addition to reading the famed and prophetic Dr. Seuss classic, kids discussed ways to celebrate Mother Earth every day at home by reducing waste, recycling trash and reusing items. Kids made their own Earth Day “Dirt Cup”snacks, and afterwards used the plastic pudding cups to plant their own sunflower seeds to take home and grow.  To top off the celebration, a dogwood tree was planted in the Library garden.  
 Librarian Joy Sharp shares Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax at the Mountains Library Earth Day program.

 Construction Employment Is Climbing Across The Nation 
 Across the nation construction employment set a five year high in November adding 20,000 new jobs. Nationally, the construction unemployment rate fell to 7.5% representing the lowest unemployment rate for the month in seven years. According to Ken Simonson, the AGC of America's Chief Economist, November was a good month overall for construction workers and businesses. November continues a slow and steady recovery from the recession. 
 According to the latest available statistics construction employment expanded in 228 metro areas, declined in 64 areas and was unchanged in 47 market areas between October 2013 and October 2014. AGC of America Association officials noted that newly released federal figures show construction spending increased by 3.3% between October 2013 and October 2014 as demand slowly expanded. As construction activity increases the challenge for firms is rapidly becoming the acquisition of qualified employees to perform the work needed to move construction projects forward. In fact, 83 percent of firms reported trouble finding qualified workers which is impacting competition and driving many firms to change the way they operate. 
 In Tennessee, from October 2013 to October 2014 construction employment grew by 6% adding an additional 7,000 jobs. The rate of growth varied by market area with the Cleveland,Tennessee area growing by 19% and Nashville - Davidson - Murfreesboro-Franklin growing by 11%.

 What Our Customers Are Saying  
   
     “My husband and I were on the verge of disconnecting DIRECTV due to continual problems since the onset of our service until today. Technician John L came today to our rescue and that is just what he did. Not only did he discover that we were never set-up  correctly but he also was the most informative technician we have had through DIRECTV. Due to his service, we now intend to keep our DIRECTV and we couldn’t thank him enough.” 
 DIRECTV customers Brenda and Dave G. 
    
   
     “I had taken over the department and inherited an old and outdated radio system that needed to be completely redesigned. Our FCC license and the leases for our receiver sites were expired. Our sales representative was able to walk me through all the steps to get everything updated and deliver a new system that fulfills our needs.”

    ON-BOARDING STUDIES 
 
 Employees who have a great experience in the first 90 days are 10 times more likely to stay for a long time than those with a poor experience.  You must understand how your employees feel about their on-boarding experience and The Work Institute can help.
